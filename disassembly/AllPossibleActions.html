Here's a concept (an outline) for documenting all possible actions and much of the pseudocode/algorithms in one place. The logic would be as complete as possible; this file would be very, very large.
<p>
This file constitutes original research. Nothing was written in here without documenting in the disassembly. But, there are probably errors in it.
<p>
Definitions:
[X,Y] - an inclusive range
<br />{X,Y} - A random chance, if rand() is matching [X,Y]

		<li>Search:
		Write a lot of pseudocode and such here. But really, at a logical level, it's just, is there anything there? So maybe not.

			<li>Fight:
			<br />If the FALCON_SWORD is equipped, the player will run all the subsequent attack logic twice (>99.9% identical to a single attack), except that processing is terminated if all the enemies or players have died.
			<br />Fighters get a chance to enable crit which is {0,LV}; All classes get a chance to enable crit of {0,3}. The crit enables don't stack.
			<br />Passive effects resulting from equipped gear:
			<ul>
			<li>SWORD_OF_DESTRUCTION: ATTACK_BUFF_HIGHER_CRIT. Moreover, there's a {192,255} chance that the attacker will be immobilized in place of the attack.
			<li>STAFF_OF_FORCE: no special effects known, but it's been programmed in as a test
			<li>POISON_NEEDLE: ATTACK_BUFF_POISON_NEEDLE (TBD)
			<li>DEMON_AXE: ATTACK_BUFF_DEMON_AXE and ATTACK_BUFF_HIGHER_CRIT
			<li>MULTIEDGE_SWORD: ATTACK_BUFF_MULTI_EDGE
			<li>ZOMBIE_SLASHER: Not sure at all what this does. Presumably a racial check gets done later but I dont see it yet.
			<li>DRAGON_KILLER:  - I think buff flag ATTACK_BUFF_FLAG_RACIAL_WEAKNESS is set if the target enemy is a dragon: (SNOW_DRAGON,SALAMANDER,GREEN_DRAGON,SKY_DRAGON,SCALGON,PUTREGON)
			<hr />
			<li>ATTACK_BUFF_HIGHER_CRIT: Normal {0,3} crit chance is replaced with {0,31}
			<li>ATTACK_BUFF_FLAG_RACIAL_WEAKNESS: [0,15] + 16 additional damage
			<li>ATTACK_BUFF_POISON_NEEDLE: The attack cannot crit. More enemy traits and defenses may be avoided (uncertain right now). {0,$1F} chance of penetrating the enemy's defenses (instant kill).

			</ul>

			<li>Spell: If the ITEM_MYSTERIOUS_HAT is equipped, MP cost is adjusted to (mp*3/4+1) unless it's 0, in which case it stays 0. (TODO write about blocking logic) If MP is adequate, cost is deducted.

				<li>$00 - ITEM_CYPRESS_STICK: (can't pick target, no effect)

				<li>$65 - ITEM_MEDICAL_HERB: When using on players, see Field::Item entry.
				<br />What about bad guys?
				<br />Well, vs Zoma, due to his special heal->damage processing, theres a bug in the code resulting in reading outside a table, and this damage: [0,218] + 229
				<li>$67 - ITEM_FAIRY_WATER: Vs players, always "it has no effect." Vs enemies, rolls a chance approx 13/255 (TBD, enemy traits/buffs seem to be involved) to deal [0,19] + 14 as a spell. Otherwise "it has no effect"
