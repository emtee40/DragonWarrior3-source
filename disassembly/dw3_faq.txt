	There are three main menus that you'll be paying more attention to than 
anything else in the game and that's the Command menu, the Status menu, and the 
Battle menu.  When you're walking around in a town, castle, dungeon, tower, or 
on the world map and you press the A Button, 2 menus will appear:  one in the 
upper left-hand corner and one at the bottom.
 ____       ______
|----COMMAND------|
| &gt;TALK    SPELL  |
|  STATUS  ITEM   | &lt;-------- Command Menu
|  SEARCH  EQUIP  |

  | HrXX   SrXX   PrXX   WzXX  |
  |____________________________|

 _____________
|COMMAND MENU \
|_____________/

TALK:  This option will allow you to talk to the citizens of the towns and 
-----  anyone else in the game.  Stand in front of someone and select this 
       option to engage in conversation.

STATUS:  This selection will lead to a new menu that looks like this:
-------	 
	__      ______
       |--STATUS------|
       | &gt;INFO        |
       |  CONDITION   |
       |  FORMATION   |
       |______________|

          INFO:  Allows you to view the stats and current experience points of 
		 each of your characters.  This menu will also show your current
		 Gold in the top right.  If you continue to press the A Button, 
		 you'll be able to see the equipment that character has on 
		 along with his or her spells.

	  CONDITION:  This selection brings up another window that shows the 
		      current HP and MP status of all of your characters.  This 
		      is displayed as a fraction; the top number is the 
		      characters' current HP/MP while the bottom number is the 
		      characters' maximum HP/MP.

	  FORMATION:  The Formation option allows you to change the party's 
		      current line-up.  Select the character on the left using 
		      the cursor and place them in descending order from 
		      positions 1 through 4.

SEARCH:  Use the Search option to check the ground beneath your feet or to open 
-------  treasure chests.  Stand on top of a chest and use this option to 
	 obtain the item inside.

SPELL:  The Spell selection will bring up a smaller window showing each of your 
------  characters.  Choose which character you want to cast the spell and then 
	a list of field spells will appear in another window for that particular
	character.  Keep in mind that Soldiers, Fighters, Merchants, and Goof-
	Offs do not gain MP to cast spells.

ITEM:  Brings up each characters' inventory.  This allows you to use items, like
-----  Medical Herbs, Antidotes, Thief's Key, etc. on the field or world map.
       When you select an item or piece of equipment, another menu will pop up 
       that looks like this:
      ______________
     |              |
     | &gt;USE         |
     |  TRANSFER    |
     |  DISCARD     |
     |______________|

	  USE:  This option will simply use the item on which ever character 
		you choose afterward.

          TRANSFER:  Transfer allows you to give an item or piece of equipment 
                     to another party member.

	  DISCARD:  Using this option will let you throw away an item that you 
		    don't want.  Be careful, though.  Once you throw an item 
		    away you can't get it back (however, with some items the 
                    game won't allow you to discard them).

          APPRAISE:  This option is only available to a Merchant.  Using the 
		     Appraise option will allow the Merchant to study the item
		     selected and tell you which characters can equip it and 
                     how much the item is worth.  A very useful thing to use 
                     when shopping for items or equipment.

EQUIP:  The Equip selection will bring up a smaller window listing your
------  characters.  Select which character you wish to equip and it'll allow 
	you to customize which equipment you want that person to wear.  It'll 
	go through Weapon, Armor, Shield, and Helmet (in that order).

 ____________
|STATUS MENU \
|____________/

	This menu will appear at the bottom of your screen when you press the 
A Button on the field (along with the Command Menu).  Also, if you stand and 
wait a few seconds the Status Menu will appear by itself.  Here, you'll see 
all of your characters listed with their corresponding HP and MP conditions.  
The 'H' obviously standing for Hitpoints and the 'M' standing for Magic points.
Underneath this, you'll see the character class's abbreviation (Hr for Hero, 
Sr for Soldier, etc.) and their current level.  Sometimes you'll see a two-
letter abbreviation covering the character's level.  This means that character 
has a status ailment that you have not yet cured.  We'll get into that soon, but
there's one more menu to become familiar with.

 ____________
|BATTLE MENU \
|____________/

	Anytime you're roaming around on the world map or in caves or towers, 
it's very likely you'll be engaged in a random battle.  This will trigger 
another screen to appear consisting of 3 initial windows and the monsters in 
the center of the screen.  Your screen will look very similar to this:

       _    ___    ___    ___    __
      |-Hero---Sold---Pilg---Wiza--|
      | H XXX  H XXX  H XXX  H XXX |
      | M XXX  M XXX  M XXX  M XXX |
      | HrXX   SrXX   PrXX   WzXX  |
      |____________________________|





       __    ___  ____________________
      |==Hero===||  Enemy A (X)       |
      | &gt;FIGHT  ||  Enemy B (X)       |
      |  SPELL  ||  Enemy C (X)       |
      |  RUN    ||____________________|
      |  ITEM   |
      |_________|

	The top window you should already be familiar with; this is the status 
menu that you see when you press the A Button on the field (or if you stand 
still for a few seconds).  The bottom two windows are the battle windows.

	Let's start with the bottom left window.  First of all, you'll see which
character you're controlling by looking at the name at the very top.  In this 
case, the Hero is the first character to have a command selected.  Now, let's 
look at the other four options you have:

FIGHT:  This option is the one you'll use the most in battle; hands down.  It 
------  simply allows that character to attack physically against whichever 
	enemy you choose.

SPELL:  The Spell option will bring up another window where you can select 
------  which spell you want to use against the enemy.  However, not all 
	character classes have this option (like the Soldier and Fighter, for 
	instance).

RUN:  Using Run will give you the opportunity to flee from the battle.  This 
----  option doesn't always work, though.  Occasionally, if the monsters 
      are much stronger than you are, they will block your escape path and 
      you are forced to continue battle for at least one more round.  You can 
      continue choosing Run each round in hopes of being able to escape, but 
      sometimes it takes several rounds before you can flee.

ITEM:  This selection will bring up a new window containing that character's 
-----  inventory.  It will allow you to use healing/support items on allies or 
       use offensive items on enemies.  Particularly weapons that have battle 
       effects like the Staff of Thunder.

PARRY:  The Parry option is available to anyone who is not in the first position
------  in formation.  Parry will simply put the character in a state of 
	defense where they will not attack, but simply half the damage they 
	would normally receive were they not to Parry.  This option becomes 
	very useful when the character's HP is in critical condition and 
	they're	waiting for another character to heal them.

	The window to the right of the battle selection window will show, in 
text, the enemies you're fighting and the quantity.  It will have their names 
along with a number to the right stating how many there are.  When you have 
more than one of the same enemy in a battle, these are what we call monster 
groups.  A lot of the offensive spells that Wizards and Sages learn target 
groups during battle in addition to single targets and all targets.  After 
selecting a battle command for a character (Fight and Spell in particular), a 
cursor will appear next to the monster you want to attack.  Simply select which 
enemy you want to attack and you'll move onto the next character.

	Once you have defeated all of the monsters in the battle, a victory 
message will appear and another window will show up displaying the total 
experience points each character has along with your current total Gold coins.

	That about does it for the main menus in Dragon Warrior III.  You'll 
come across others during your quest but nothing that isn't self-explanitory.

	Your characters' stats are what determine how strong they are in battle.
There are ten basic stats each character has that determine their strengths and
weaknesses:

- Strength
- Agility
- Vitality
- Intelligence
- Luck
- Maximum H.P.
- Maximum M.P.
- Attack Power
- Defence Power
- Experience Points

STRENGTH:  This is the base stat for determining how strong a character's 
---------  physical attack is.  The higher the strength, the higher a 
	   character will be able to hit on an enemy; that simple.

AGILITY:  Agility is the stat that determines how soon a character will attack 
--------  in battle.  If you have a character with 50 Agility and another with 
	  30, the person with 50 Agility will obviously attack first.  This 
	  works the same way when comparing yourself to enemies.  Also, Agility 
	  can be the factor that determines how often you can dodge attacks.  
	  Obviously, having high Agility can only work in your favor.

VITALITY:  High Vitality ultimately yields to higher Hitpoints.  You'll find 
---------  that Vitality is efficiently present in Soliders and in some cases 
	   your Hero.  Any character that strictly goes for physical attacks 
	   should have a decent amount of Vitality.

INTELLIGENCE:  Intelligence is a stat that all magic-users should focus on.  
-------------  The higher a character's Intelligence, the more MP growth they 
	       will ultimately get.  Wizards, Pilgrims, and Sages generally 
	       have high Intelligence making their MP plentiful.  A character 
	       who is very high in Intelligence generally will learn spells 
	       sooner than normal as well.

LUCK:  Luck has always been a mysterious stat growth in the Dragon Warrior 
-----  series.  Generally, Luck can determine when a character will dodge an 
       attack when their HP is critical and other things of that nature.  It 
       can also determine a player's tremendous hit ratio in battle.  There are
       theories that suggest higher Luck allows you to avoid instant-death 
       spells like Beat/Defeat more often.  The only character class that shows 
       decent growth in Luck is the Goof-Off.

MAXIMUM H.P.:  Pretty self-explanitory; the total Hitpoints or &quot;life&quot; each 
-------------  character possesses.  This stat generally sky-rockets with 
	       Soldiers and Fighters.  When a character's Maximum H.P. is 
	       depleted in battle, the character is knocked out and is no 
	       longer useable until you revive him or her.

MAXIMUM M.P.:  Another self-explanitory stat; the total Magic points a 
-------------  player has in order to cast spells.  Each time you cast a spell 
	       in battle or on the field, a portion of your MP is drained.  
	       When a character's MP is at 0 they can no longer cast anymore 
	       spells until it is replenished.

ATTACK POWER:  This stat goes hand-in-hand with Strength, but there's a notable 
-------------  difference.  Any time a character equips a weapon, the amount of 
	       power attached to the weapon is added to your Strength to give 
	       you the total Attack Power.  For example, if your Hero has 50 
	       Strength and he or she equips the Broad Sword (which has +33 
	       Attack Power), your Hero's Attack Power stat would be 83 (50 + 
	       33 = 83).  If that character doesn't have any kind of weapon 
	       equipped, their Strength and Attack Power will be identical.

DEFENCE POWER:  Defence Power works the same way as Attack Power.  When a 
--------------  player equips certain pieces of armor along with shields and 
	        helmets, it will add to the Defence Power stat.  Each piece of 
		equipment has its own Defence Power that will add to your 
		character when equipped.

EXPERIENCE POINTS:  This last one really isn't a stat so-to-speak, but it's a 
------------------  number that determines what level your character has.  The 
                    higher your Experience Points, the higher the level of your 
                    character.  After each battle, your party is awarded 
		    Experience Points along with Gold coins.  When a particular 
		    character has enough Experience points to reach the next 
		    level, a message will appear and it will show you which 
		    stats are being raised by how much.

	Status ailments are conditions that your characters can sometimes be 
put under during battle.  Many enemies that you'll encounter in the game can 
inflict harmful statuses such as poison, confusion, paralysis, etc. on your 
party and can only be healed with special items that you can purchase in shops. 
Below is a chart that lists all of the possible status ailments in the game 
along with their negative effects, menu abbreviations, and remedies:

	One of the things that sets Dragon Warrior III apart from the previous 
two is the option to recruit up to three other customized characters to join 
you during your quest.  You can do this by registering more characters at 
Luisa's Place in Aliahan after speaking with the King when you start your game.

	Each class offers its own advantages and disadvantages to your journey.
Reading below may help you decide which characters you want to bring along, but 
keep in mind that it's completely up to you.  Certain characters are stronger 
in certain areas than others, but a really good all-around team would consist of
your Hero, a Fighter or Soldier, a Pilgrim, and a Wizard.  But I'll let you be 
the judge! :)

	A pretty decent all-around character.  This will be the main character 
that you play throughout the course of the game.  Their Strength isn't the 
best, but they house decent magic which makes them much more useful.  Regardless
of how you look at it, you have to bring the Hero along so you can't really 
complain.

 _________
|FIGHTER  \
|_________/

HP:             High
MP:             None
Strength:       Very High
Agility:        Very High
Intelligence:   Low
Vitality:       Very High
Luck:           Mediocre
Attack Power:   Very High
Defence Power:  Very High

	The ideal physical attacker next to the Soldier.  If you're looking for 
someone who's fast, high-hitting, and doesn't require a lot of money to spend 
on equipment then a Fighter is your best choice.  Even though they don't gain 
any MP, their high attack and swiftness makes up for it and exceeds 
expectations.

 _________
|SOLDIER  \
|_________/

HP:             Very High
MP:             None
Strength:       Very High
Agility:        Low
Intelligence:   Low
Vitality:       Very High
Luck:           Mediocre
Attack Power:   Very High
Defence Power:  High

	As close to a mirror-image of a Fighter as you can get.  The only thing 
a Soldier has that the Fighter doesn't is the ability to weild heavy equipment 
making their Defence Power incredible.  However, Soldiers are also much slower 
than Fighters.  One of the main reasons to use a Soldier over a Fighter is to 
gain a little bit more Attack Power, Defence Power, and HP.

	The main focus of a Wizard is his/her Intelligence and MP; making them 
a perfect addition to your party when you need some strong offensive spells 
and a little magical support.  However, once you get the option to change them 
into a Sage at the Shrine of Dhama, do so.  Wizards are not good to keep 
throughout the entire game simply because a Sage will learn all of the spells 
that Wizards and Pilgrims learn combined.  Don't get me wrong, though.  A Wizard
is ideal to have towards the beginning of the game.

	A pretty well-rounded character.  Pilgrims are mainly useful for their 
abundance of healing and support magic, while Wizards focus more on offensive 
and defensive magic.  This is another class that proves very helpful when you 
start out your journey.  The Pilgrim is also a good class to turn into a Sage 
later on, but most players who use them prefer to keep the Pilgrim strictly for 
healing and support purposes.

 __________
|MERCHANT  \
|__________/

HP:             Mediocre
MP:             None
Strength:       Mediocre
Agility:        Mediocre
Intellilgence:  Mediocre
Vitality:       Mediocre
Luck:           Mediocre
Attack Power:   Low
Defence Power:  Mediocre

	As you can see, the Merchant is a very average character.  There's 
nothing really worth taking note of with this class.  The only thing that sets 
them apart from the others is their ability to appraise an item and 
occasionally dig up some more Gold coins at the end of battle.  Their 
equipment selection is quite limited and they don't have outstanding stats in 
any particular area.  They can be quite useful at the very beginning of the 
game, however.  But they lose their usefulness as you get further.

 __________
|GOOF-OFF  \
|__________/

HP:             Very Low
MP:             None
Strength:       Mediocre
Agility:        Mediocre
Intelligence:   Mediocre
Vitality:       Mediocre
Luck:           Very High
Attack Power:   Very Low
Defence Power:  Low

	A very unique character indeed.  Goof-Offs are borderline useless 
until they hit level 20 when you can change their class to a Sage without the 
need of the Book of Satori.  The only thing worth taking note of is their 
extremely high Luck stat.  However, with as many other stats that are low or 
average, their high Luck doesn't do much for them.  Also, their equipment 
selection is very limited.

 ______
|SAGE  \
|______/

HP:             High
MP:             Very High
Strength:       Mediocre
Agility:        Mediocre
Intelligence:   Very High
Vitality:       High
Luck:           Mediocre
Attack Power:   Very High
Defence Power:  Very High
  ______
 / NOTE \_________________
| Sages learn both Wizard |
| and Pilgrim spells at   |
| the same level.         |
|_________________________|

	Probably one of the most useful characters available in the game.  The 
Sage offers all that of a Wizard and a Pilgrim plus more.  They have very good 
Attack Power along with their great MP and Intelligence.  Making them the 
ultimate spell-caster, it's foolish to pass up the opportunity to change one of 
your initial characters into a Sage when you get the chance.  They also have a 
much broader selection with equipment compared to the Wizard or Pilgrim.

-  SAVE OFTEN!  I know you've heard this 1,000,001 times but I can't stress it 
   enough.  You never know what's right around the corner or what may happen to
   your game while you're playing (freezing).  You can save your game any time 
   at a King or Queen in places like Aliahan, Romaly, Isis, etc.

-  Talk to anyone and everyone you come across.  Most of what people have to say
   has something to do with the story or gives some sort of hint as to what you 
   need to do next.  Utilize this option and you'll enjoy the game much more!

-  You may not always need to upgrade your equipment once something new 
   becomes available.  But when you know you'll need something to last you 
   through a couple of dungeons, spend wisely.  If you need to, consult this 
   document so you don't spend money on weapons/armor that no one in your party 
   can equip.

-  You don't have to follow my Recommended Level with each section.  I really 
   just put that up there for reference.  It's the level my party was at during
   that specified time.  As a side-effect of running around trying to complete 
   the Monster list for each area, my party was a bit over-leveled for a vast 
   majority of the game.  There's absolutely no shame in being a whole 3-4 
   levels lower than my party.  As a matter of fact, I encourage it.  Nothing 
   sucks the fun out of an RPG like being a powerhouse.

-  Get rid of pesky status ailments as soon as you can.  It's not fun getting 
   inflicted with poison right when you enter a cave or dungeon and you don't 
   have the right spell or item to cure it.  Keep a decent amount of Antidote 
   Herbs, Full Moon Herbs, and Medical Herbs with you until you're able to 
   cast spells that serve the same purpose.

-  Never run away from a random battle unless you have to.  If your party is on 
   the brink of annihilation and there doesn't look like there's any hope of 
   survival, then RUN!  Otherwise, killing off any enemies in your way will 
   only help you level up and get stronger.  You'll need the experience for 
   future boss fights.

-  Utilize the Vault when you can.  This will prevent you from losing half of 
   your current funds when you die in battle.  Trust me, nothing is more 
   frustrating than having thousands of gold coins and then dying and losing 
   what you have worked so hard for.  Vaults can be found in major towns and 
   cities like Aliahan.  It's also wise to leave several key items in the Vault 
   when you no longer need them.  For example, when you obtain the Magic Key 
   your Thief's Key will no longer be needed.  There is a fee, however, for 
   taking items back out.  For important story items, the fee is only 1G coin.  
   But for other items (like equipment and so forth), the fee charge will vary.
   I also like to place any and all stat-boosting seeds I find throughout the
   game in the Vault.  This way, when I'm near the end of the game I can take 
   them out and distribute them amongst my characters after I've done all the
   level-grinding I want to do.  This will get the most out of your seeds.

-  Whenever you come out of a battle and you notice the text color has changed 
   from white to green, this means that one or more of your characters' HP is in
   critical condition.  Treat this as a signal to use any healing spell or item
   that you have.  There are 4 different colored texts that you'll see:

   White = normal
   Blue = night time has approached
   Green = one or more characters' HP in critical condition
   Red = one or more party members are dead

-  If for any reason you're having trouble understanding my directions in caves,
   towers, or other dungeons throughout the game, use the maps provided below.
   Thanks to Woodus' Dragon's Den, there are several overworld maps along with
   maps of just about every town and dungeon in the game.  If you'd rather use
   the maps to locate all the treasure and navigate your way through, be my

	After entering your Hero's name and their gender, you'll be awakened by 
your mother.  Follow her down the stairs and she'll lead you outside to the 
castle.  After she's finished talking, walk north to the castle and go inside.

	There aren't any items to be gathered yet, but speak with the guards 
and citizens inside if you wish.  When you're done checking the place out, head 
up the stairs in the center of the first floor.  Speak with the King on the 
second floor and he'll inform you of your goal:  defeat the Archfiend Baramos 
before he completely destroys the world.  Simple enough...

	The King will hand over 50G coins for you to get started and he'll 
recommend that you visit the local eatery so you can register some companions 
to aid you during your quest.  Exit the castle and head west to the edge of 
town.  The building in the northwest corner of town is where we need to go.  
Once inside, head north and you'll see a person standing behind a counter in 
the back.  If you speak with them, they'll already have allies registered that 
you can recruit.  However, if you go upstairs and speak with the man behind 
the counter on the second floor, you can customize your own companions.  I 
would suggest registering your own simply because you can name them and choose 
which classes you want.

	It's completely up to you which classes you want to take along with you.
I personally chose a male Soldier, a female Pilgrim, and a female Wizard.  
Once you've done this, head back downstairs and speak with the person behind 
the counter on the first floor in the back.  Here, you'll be able to add the 
members you want to your party.  Choose the three characters that you just 
registered and you're on your way.

	Back outside, you can either check out the shops or leave the town.  
Since you only have 50G right now, it's best that you leave and fight around 
the Aliahan area to work up some experience and gold.  Once you have a decent 
amount of money on you, be sure to purchase any equipment you may need at the 
Weapons/Armor Shop.  You may even want to buy a few Medical Herbs at the 
Tool Shop.

	Just fight the Slimes and Black Ravens around the area until you're 
about level 3 or 4.  At this point, your Pilgrim or Hero should have learned 
the Heal spell.  This will prove very useful during your first couple of 
dungeons.  You should also take note that your mother will allow you to rest 
at your house for free at any time.  This way, you won't have to spend 8G coins 
at the Inn each time your party needs to heal up.  When you're all rested and 
ready, leave Aliahan and cross the bridge to the west.  Keep walking west until 
you see the coast and then turn south.  Follow this peninsula all the way 
down through the forest to find a cave at the very tip.

	Head down the first set of stairs you see in the bottom left corner.  
Walk east on the bottom floor and follow the path up to a larger room.  Continue
walking and enter the smaller room in the southeast corner to find a treasure 
chest with a MEDICAL HERB.

	Return to the large room and take the narrow path to the north.  Follow 
this east into another room in which you'll find another treasure chest in the 
center.  Open it up for the WAYFARER'S CLOTHES and then walk north from the 
chest a few steps and you'll see another small pathway leading up.  Walk through
this narrow walkway into a smaller room with another chest.  Search this chest 
for 16G coins.

	That's about all there is to this cave.  There is a set of stairs that 
lead up to the Tower of Najima near the chest that contained the Wayfarer's 
Clothes, but we're not yet ready to tackle it yet.

	For now, exit the cave the way you came in and return to Aliahan to 
rest at your house.  You should be able to upgrade your equipment a bit with 
the money you received from fighting inside the cave, so take the opportunity 
to do that now.  You'll also want to purchase 3 or 4 Antidote Herbs before you 
take on the Tower of Najima.  There are poisonous enemies on the top floors 
that can get in the way.

	Once you've rested and purchased anything you might need, leave
Aliahan and cross the bridge again to the west.  Just follow the open field 
north and you'll come to a town called Reeve.  Before we check this place 
out, we're going to get the Thief's Key inside the Tower of Najima.  Just to 
the south of Reeve in the forest you'll see a small patch of land with no 
trees.  Walk onto this path and you'll enter a clearing.  Here you'll see a 
small building with a door you cannot open yet and a set of stairs.  Take the 
stairs down to enter the tower.

	Follow the path you're on south and then all the way west passing the 
giant door you see.  When the walkway turns south at the end, head into the 
room on your left to find a treasure chest containing 32G coins.  Return to 
the pathway you came from and follow it all the way south into a larger room 
with four pillars.  Just below these pillars is a staircase leading up to the 
first floor.

	Head north for awhile and you'll see a room on your left with another 
staircase leading into a small basement.  Here you'll find a guy who will let 
your party rest for a fee of 8G coins.  Wouldn't you know it, an Inn in the 
middle of a monster-infested tower.  If you feel like you need to rest, do so 
and then head back up and walk directly across from the Inn to a room with 
a set of stairs leading up to the 2nd floor.

	From where you start, walk west into the next room and then north.  
You'll come to a two-way split.  Walk into the room on your left and you'll 
find a chest with 40G coins.  Now walk over to the room on the right and take 
the stairs up to an isolated room with another treasure chest.  Search this 
chest to obtain a LEATHER HELMET (good for the Hero or Soldier) and then 
return to the 2nd floor.  Now walk back to the stairs you took to get to this 
floor to begin with and continue south.  Follow this path around being careful 
not to step off the edge.  Pass up the first pathway you see north and go into 
the last one on the end to find more stairs in the upper corner.

	On the 3rd floor, follow the path around to the north and stay on this 
path until you see a walkway leading south.  Ignore this one, but keep going 
east and into the 2nd room below you.  Here you'll find a treasure chest which 
has a WING OF WYVERN.  Now go back the way you came and enter the first room 
that you ignored on your way to get the Wing of Wyvern.  Take the stairs you 
see in here to find yourself on the top floor.

	You'll be inside a large room with a man standing in the upper corner. 
Speak with him and he'll ask you if you want the THIEF'S KEY.  Say 'YES' and 
you'll now have the key in your possession.  Use this key to open the large 
door at the front of the room and then walk off the edge of the tower.

	When you fall down, you'll be back on the 1st floor where the Inn was.
Head down the stairs right next to you and you'll find yourself back in the 
basement.  Walk all the way north and then east to get back to the large 
wooden door that you ingored upon entering the tower.  Open this door with the 
Thief's Key to find two treasure chests containing an AGILITY SEED and a 
MEDICAL HERB.  Now just leave the room you're in and continue walking north to 
exit the tower through the stairs you entered from.

	Return to the world map and enter the town of Reeve to the north.

	The first thing you'll want to do upon arriving in Reeve is rest at the 
Inn.  If you have any poison status from the battles in the Tower of Najima 
that you haven't cured yet, do so by purchasing some Antidote Herbs from the 
Tool Shop.

	There's not much to this town really; it's rather small.  You'll 
definitely want to check out the Weapons/Armor Shop and spend some of the money 
you raked in at the Tower of Najima.  However, the main purpose you're here is 
to get your hands on the Magic Ball which will break the seal on this island 
and allow you to venture further.  Walk over to the northeast corner of Reeve 
to find a big house.  Enter using your new Thief's Key and head up the stairs.  
On the second floor, talk to the old man and he'll hand over the MAGIC BALL.  
Wow, that was easy...

	Now that you have the two items needed to continue (Thief's Key and 
Magic Ball), you're free to leave the Aliahan region via a cave in the far 
east.  You may remember seeing some locked doors back in Aliahan Castle, but 
there's no need to bother with them now because they just lead to people who 
inform you about the Magic Ball.  And since we already have the Magic Ball, 
there's no reason why we should go back (unless you want to rest at mommy's).

	Now would be a good time to head east of Reeve and fight around the 
area gaining experience and gold.  You'll want to be around level 8 or 9 before 
advancing to the Cave of Enticement in order to leave the island.  Also, don't 
forgest to stock up on some Antidote Herbs.  The Babbles can be a pain in the 
neck.

	Once you've rested and saved your game, head far east of Reeve and then 
south through some mountains to find a shrine in the southeast.  In here, a 
man will ask if you've obtained the Thief's Key and Magic Ball.  Since we 
already have these two items, there's really no reason to visit.  Exit the 
shrine and walk north between the mountains into what looks like a lake in the 
center of a forest.

	Start off by walking north around the pond here and you'll notice a 
hole in the ground just to the north.  This is your entrance.  Once you're 
inside, head west and you'll find an old man standing here.  Walk south of the 
old man and stand against the southern wall between the two statues.  Use the 
Magic Ball that you got from Reeve and the barrier will be demolished leaving 
the pathway open to the stairs.

	This next floor is the main floor of the dungeon.  Be careful as you 
walk, though.  There are pits on the floor that will put you down on the 
basement below if you fall into them.  From the stairs, walk west into the 
main hallway and then north until you come to a zig-zag shaped pit.  Walk up 
to the edge of it and take the path leading to the right and follow it up and 
around the pit.  When you find yourself on the other side, walk north and 
you'll come to a two-way split.  The western path leads to a dead end with a 
chest that contains an ANTIDOTE HERB.  Return and take the eastern path.  Follow
this path all the way east (ignoring the first hallway you see going south) and 
then south all the way to the end.  Turn west when you can and continue walking 
taking care not to fall into the pit.  When you come out into the main hallway 
again, walk north and enter the 2nd path on the left to find a chest with a 
MAGIC KNIFE.  Return and head north a little more and make a left just before 
the pit.  Follow this narrow hallway west and then north to find a set of 
stairs.

	On the bottom floor, just walk south a few steps and all the way to the 
left.  Follow the walkway on the far end south and open the large wooden door 
with the Thief's Key.  Now just follow the rest of the path south and step on 
the blue portal at the end.

	You'll be teleported into a ruined building.  Open the door in front of 
you with your key and exit.  Now just walk north from the shrine and the 
kingdom of Romaly will be in sight.  Enter.

away that it's much smaller than Aliahan.  The first thing you'll want to do

out the Weapons/Armor Shop and upgrade whatever equipment you can (might I 
suggest a Broad Sword for your Hero and Soldier).  Once you've spent all the 
money you can, you can head downstairs in the Weapons/Armor Shop and the Tool 
Shop to find a battle arena!  If you want to read more about how the Battle 
Arena works, read the next paragraph.  If not, just skip down.

	In here, you can place bets on which monster you think will win the 
battle.  After buying a ticket for 80G, you'll get to watch the battle and see 
the winner.  The whole thing is pretty much a gamble, but if you head over to 
the far right desk the person there will predict which monster will win the 
next fight.  It's up to you whether or not you want to go with his prediction 
or not.  Another way to help you decide which monster to bet on is by looking 
at the number beside their name.  The higher the number, the less likely that 
monster will win the battle.  However, if you were to bet on the monster with 
the highest number, your payoff will be MUCH higher than if you were to bet on 
the monster who's most probable to win.  For instance, say you purchase your 
ticket for 80G coins and you have a line-up like this:
 _________________________
| &gt;Magician       * 18.8  |
|  Humanabat      *  2.9  |
|  Killer Bee     *  3.0  |
|_________________________|

Let's just say we get lucky and bet on the Killer Bee who happens to win!  Yay!
The way to determine your payoff is by multiplying the 90G you spent on the 
ticket by the number next to the monster.  So, in this case, that would be 
80 * 3.0 = 240.  You would win 240G coins.  So as you can see, it's safer to 
go with the monster with the lowest number but the payoff is less.  Whereas 
if you were to bet on the monster with the highest number, the odds are 
against you but your payoff will be a lot higher.  With that said, gamble away!

	The only thing left to do in Romaly is speak with the King.  Head north 
into the castle and just keep walking straight and up the stairs to the throne 
room.  Talk with the King and he'll allow you to record your progress and save 
your game (now would be a good time to do so).  After that, he'll request that 
you help retrieve the Golden Crown that a thief by the name of Kandar stole.  
He says that once you return his Golden Crown, he'll see you as a true hero... 
whatever.

	Well it looks like we have our new objective.  But before we can go 
straight for the Golden Crown, there are several other things that need to be 
accomplished.

	Leave Romaly and fight around the area if you feel like it.  Most of 
the enemies you'll encounter here are the same from the Cave of Enticement.  
It also wouldn't hurt to rack up some gold either.  When you think you're 
ready to move on, just travel far north of Romaly to find a town in the middle 
of a mountain range.

	Enter this small town and talk to the villagers.  You'll learn that 
there's a tower far to the west called the Tower of Shanpane that we'll be 
visiting later.  For right now, though, stay at the Inn if you've been fighting 
the monsters around the Kanave area.  Check out the Weapons/Armor Shop and try 
to work for the Half Plate Armor for your Hero and Soldier (if you have one).
The Iron Claw is also a must-buy if you have a Fighter with you.

	If you head to the village eatery on the northeast corner of town, a 
woman in there speaks of a village that got put under a sleeping spell by a 
group of elves.  This town is just to the north, and that'll be part of our
next quest soon.

	Before we wave goodbye to Kanave though, be sure to come back at night 
and open the door on the side of the Tool Shop with your Thief's Key.  The 
shop owner will be asleep, but if you walk out behind the counter you'll find 
two treasure chests on either side of you.  One of them contains a CLUB while 
the other has a POISON NEEDLE.  Be sure to equip the Poison Needle on your 
Wizard if you have one.  It has low attack power, but occasionally it'll take 
out any monster in one hit!  It's a pretty useful weapon for your Wizard at 
this point in the game.

	You can fight around the area and gain some experience and gold if you 
want.  Make sure you stay at the Inn when you're ready and then head directly 
north of Kanave.  Soon, you'll see a town on the northern coast right outside 
of a forest.  This is the town of Noaniels.

	Almost immediately after trying to talk with some of the villagers 
you'll notice that they're all asleep.  Well, it looks like we've found that 
sleeping town we heard about in Kanave.  At the moment there's only one thing 
to do in Noaniels.

	From the entrance, take the southern path and follow it west until you
come to a small house in the corner.  Enter and go upstairs to find the only 
citizen that's awake.  Speak with the old man here and he'll speak of an item 
called the Dream Ruby that you must return to the elves who live in a village 
far to the west.  Only then will the sleeping spell be lifted off of Noaniels.  
Now that we have an idea of what we need to do, exit Noaniels and trek west 
and into the forest until you come to the end where you'll find a cave, and 
just above it, a small clearing in the forest.  This is the Elf Village.

	Weave your way through the trees and try speaking to some of the elf 
residents here.  You'll notice right away that they're not very friendly to 
humans.  The elf lady behind the counter in the northwest corner of the village 
even refuses to sell to humans.  Ouch.

	The reason we're here though is to speak to the Elf Queen to find out 
more about the Dream Ruby and the story behind it.  In the northeast corner of 
the village you'll find the Queen sitting on her throne.  Speak with her and 
she'll tell of her daughter, Anne, who fell in love with a human and took the 
Dream Ruby.  After the Queen basically kicks you out, leave the village and 
head south into the cave.  But first, if you haven't had the chance to rest up 
be sure to cast Return to Kanave and stay at the Inn.  When you're ready, walk 
into the cave right outside the Elf Village.

	Start off by heading south from the entrance until you see a dark 
passage way on your left.  Enter to find yourself in a room with a treasure 
chest in the corner containing a WING OF WYVERN.  Return to the hallway you 
came from and continue following it south.  Keep going until you hit a wall and 
turn to follow the path east.  Walk into the dark pathway to the north and open 
the chest in this room for 288G coins.  Now return and walk south down the 
passage entering the dark hallway all the way to the south.  Head down the 
stairs you see here.

	Walk west and down another set of stairs after that and you'll find 
yourself in another room with a chest.  Open the chest near you for some ACORNS
OF LIFE and then walk north and up the stairs you see here.  Head up one more 
floor and you'll be back on the first floor that you entered on with a set of 
stairs directly to your left.  Head down these stairs to the floor below.

	Follow the path south and walk north around the pond here to end up in 
a small area where you can stand in the center of the four rock pillars to 
replenish your party's HP and MP!  A very helpful structure if you're finding 
that the enemies in here are tough.  If you'd like, you can hang around here 
and level up while making sure to step onto the healing tile when needed.  
Either way, take this opportunity to heal your party and then follow the 
passage west and then north from the room with the healing structure.  Keep 
walking north ignoring the passage on your left for right now.  When you come 
to a two-way split, take the left path into a room with a treasure chest 
containing a MAGIC KNIFE.  Now go back and take the path on the right into a 
room with a chest in the center.  Open it up for a STRENGTH SEED.  Now trek 
back to the hallway that you ignored on your way up here.  Take it west and 
then south into a room with a staircase that you should take.

	Head west and you'll notice a set of stairs in the center of the room.  
Ignore them for now and take the southern path below them.  At the split, enter 
the room on the right where you'll find a treasure chest with 80G coins.  Go 
back and return to where the stairs were that you ignored and walk west from 
them.  Keep going west until you see a dark pathway on the opposite wall.  
Enter here and follow the narrow hallway south to a chest with 224G coins 
inside.  Go back the way you came and there will be another dark opening in the 
opposite wall.  Walk into it here where you'll find a staircase and a chest 
right next to it.  Open the chest for a FAIRY WATER and then go back into the 
main hallway and go south into another dark opening on the right to find a 
chest with 48G coins.  Now return to the stairs that you just saw next to the 
treasure chest that had the Fairy Water.  Go down these stairs to find yourself 
on the bottom floor.

	Just follow the path north and then to the right across the bridge to 
the treasure chest in the center of the pillars.  Open this chest to find the 
DREAM RUBY that we came for.  Attached to the Dream Ruby is a message written 
by Anne to her mother.  After obtaining the Dream Ruby, it would be wise to 
cast Outside instead of walking all the way back out.  The monsters in here are 
brutal, and I'm sure you're just about out of MP from Heal.  Which ever method 
you use to exit the cave, once you're out head back to the Elf Village.

	Walk up and speak with the Queen and she'll immediately notice the 
Dream Ruby that you carry.  She then hands over the WAKE UP POWDER so that you 
can wake the town of Noaniels.  Despite your efforts, though, the elves still 
remain very hostile to humans.

	Leave the Elf Village and return to Noaniels.  Upon entering the town, 
go into your inventory and use the Wake Up Powder.  The villagers will wake up 
and you'll now have the opportunity to rest at the Inn and check out the shops 
(see section 2C. Noaniels for shop lists).  Explore the town a bit and talk to 
the citizens if you wish.

	Now that we've returned the Dream Ruby and awoke Noaniels, we still 
need to find the thief that stole the Golden Crown from the King of Romaly.  
Remember that tower the villagers of Kanave spoke of in the west?  That's our 
next destination.  You may want to fight around the Noaniels area (or in the 
cave where the healing tile was) to gain some levels because we'll have a boss 
fight coming up soon.  When you're all rested and ready, return to Kanave and 
travel west.  Go south across a bridge when you come to it and walk a bit 
southwest until you see the tower.  This is the Tower of Shanpane.  If you don't
have a Pilgrim in your party, you may want to bring along several Medical Herbs
just in case.

	The first floor of the tower is pretty straight-forward.  Just follow 
the path west, then north, and then southwest.  When you see an opening in the 
wall to your left, walk through and then go south and around the bottom to 
the right.  Eventually you'll come to a treasure chest at the end in a corner 
containing a WING OF WYVERN.  Now retrace your steps and head up those stairs 
you more than likely saw on your way to the chest.

	On the second floor, exit the room you start in to the left and then 
turn north.  Just follow the wall on your right all the way up and then head 
around to your right and south into another room right as the floor cuts off.
In here you'll find a staircase in the southeast corner of the room.  Take 
these up to the third floor.

	From the stairs, walk northeast and then make a left into an area with 
a treasure chest in the northern corner.  Open it up for 384G coins and then 
return to the stairs that you came from.  Pass the stairs moving west all the 
way to the edge of the tower (don't fall!) and turn north.  Walk all the way 
up to the northern edge of the tower and head right into a &quot;hidden&quot; room with 
a set of stairs leading to the floor above.  Take them.

	Now we're on the fourth floor.  Just walk clockwise against the wall 
below you and you'll come to a large door on the bottom.  Using your Thief's 
Key, open the door and walk north to the stairs at the end of the room.

	On this floor you'll find two guys sitting around at a table.  Take a 
few steps towards them and they'll back off and go tell the &quot;boss&quot;.  Before you 
follow them up the stairs, make sure you HEAL YOUR PARTY to the max.

	When you follow the henchmen up the stairs to the very top floor, walk 
up a bit and the thieves will speak, but it's a trap!  Kandar will open a trap 
door and you'll fall back down to the floor below.  But we can't let them get 
away!  Go back up the stairs and they've disappeared and taken the treasure 
with them.  Just walk off the northern edge of this floor and you'll fall 
down to the fourth floor where you'll see Kandar and his Henchmen.  Make sure
everyone is replenished, then approach Kandar for a battle.

	Kandar will then start begging for mercy.  Regardless of what you say, 
you'll eventually have to let him go.  When you do, he leaves the Golden Crown 
in a chest right in front of you and then jumps off the edge of the tower...

	Take the GOLDEN CROWN and then do the same by jumping off the edge.  
Either use your Wing of Wyvern you got from the tower or cast Return to Romaly 
and let's return the crown to the King.

NOTE:  If you'd rather keep the Golden Crown for yourself (it's a one-of-a-kind
       item) then you have to avoid the King of Romaly for the rest of the game;
       meaning you can no longer save your game at Romaly because the King will
       automatically take the crown from you.  As far as defense the Golden
       Crown is nothing special, but it's up to you whether or not you want to
       keep it for yourself.  If you want to keep it, skip this section and 
       NEVER save at Romaly if you have the crown in your inventory.

	Head up to Romaly Castle and upstairs to speak with the King.  He'll 
start to praise you and then ask if you would like to be the King.  You have 
two choices here:  If you continue to select NO, nothing will happen.  Unlike
the versions of DWIII to follow this one, you can't refuse the King's offer.

	If you choose YES, you'll know be the new King of Romaly.  You'll no 
longer have the rest of your companions with you and you'll lose all your items 
(temporarily).  The only thing you can do is walk around the castle and town 
speaking with the citizens of Romaly.  The guards at the front entrance won't 
allow you to leave, so there's really nothing to do other than have fun talking 
to the villagers.  At any time, however, you can choose to return to your 
journey by going into the Battle Arena downstairs in the shops and speaking with
the former king in blue by the counter.  He'll ask if you'd like to carry on 
and you can choose NO to return to your journey.  You'll then end up back at 
the castle with your companions and all of your items.

	Now that we've returned the Golden Crown, we can continue on our quest.
Leave Romaly and head east and then south.  You'll soon come to a bridge that 
leads further east.  Cross this bridge and then head southeast until you come 
to a town.

	Welcome to the town of Assaram.  This town is a bit different than the 
others you have visited so far.  At night, Assaram has different shops than 
they do during the day.  Plus, you can have some other fun at night. ;)

	During the day, The two shops in the northeast corner of town will have 
the items in the first two lists you see above (for TOOL SHOP and WEAPONS/ARMOR 
SHOP (DAY)).  However, there are also two other shops in town that do not use 
set prices.  As you've noticed, the MERCHANT #1 and #2 that I've listed have 
a price range next to their wares.  

	You can find Merchant #1 in the very northwest corner of town.  When 
you select which item you want to buy, he'll pitch the item at an outrageous 
price WAY beyond your current funds.  The trick with this guy is to refuse and 
select NO to each price he gives you.  After the third time you refuse, he'll 
give you the item at the lowest price he's willing to offer (which still isn't 
too cheap).  If you refuse a fourth time he just won't sell you the item.  The 
only piece of equipment you should consider buying from him is the Iron Helmet 
for your Hero, Soldier, and Pilgrim if you have one.  The cheapest he'll sell 
the Battle Axe for is 5000G, but you'll be able to buy one at night for half the
price.  The Giant Shears is a powerful weapon for the Soldier, but you'll be 
able to buy one in the next town for only 3700G coins.  Although that Staff of
Force may be appealing, 5000G is a little high right now.  If you have a Wizard
with you, the Staff of Force may prove useful in a future dungeon we'll have to
explore when we aren't allowed to use magic.  Come back later for this weapon.

	Merchant #2 is located just above the Theater on the southwest corner 
of town.  He sells the common items that you've seen already but at very high 
prices.  Even his cheapest prices aren't appealing, so don't even bother with 
this guy.

	When you come back at night, another Weapons/Armor Shop will open just 
north of the fountain in the center of town.  Here's where you can buy a 
Battle Axe for your Hero for 2500G.  If you don't have all the money necessary 
to make these purchases, don't worry.  You can always come back plus the shops 
in the next town will sell a lot of the same items.  The Theater also opens at 
night.  You can head over there if you want to watch a bunch of guys drool over 
the belly dancers on stage, but you won't be able to open that red door in the 
corner until you obtain the Magic Key.

	There's one more thing you can do at night.  If you walk to the center 
of town you'll see a belly dancer standing near the water.  When you talk to 
her, she'll ask if you want your &quot;fortune&quot; told.  If you select YES, she'll ask 
you to follow her to her house but she'll only allow the Hero inside (or who 
ever is in the lead of the party at the time).  Follow her upstairs and speak 
with her on the bed.  A series of interesting dialogue takes place; we'll leave
it at that.

	That's about all there is to Assaram.  After you've done your shopping 
and exploring, head far southwest of Assaram into a giant desert.  The easiest 
way to find Isis is to walk directly west once you reach the large desert 
until you hit a mountain range on the western edge of the desert (ignoring the 
Pyramid you may pass along the way).  Now just follow the mountains south until 
you come to an oasis in the southwest corner of the desert.  Enter the oasis by 
walking into the trees in the bottom left corner to find the castle-town of 
Isis.

	First thing's first, rest at the Inn no matter what.  I'm pretty sure 
that if you've been following close to the levels of my party, your's will be 
exhausted after treking across that desert.  The best thing to do at the moment 
is check out the shops for anything you might need.  Although the only thing 
appealing at the Weapons/Armor Shop is the Full Plate Armor for your Hero and 
Soldier.  If your Soldier doesn't have some Giant Shears yet then be sure to 
buy those if you have the money.

	One thing to note about Isis is that in the northwest corner of town 
you'll find a small building with a staircase leading underground.  Down here 
you'll find another Battle Arena like the one in Romaly.  The only difference 
about this one is that some of the monsters that battle are more recent ones 
you've encountered and your pay-off may be higher.  Gamble away if you'd like, 
but once you're done head to Isis Castle in the center of town.

	Before you just walk directly north into the castle itself, walk all 
the way to the left of the entrance past the guards and you'll find an opening 
in the trees.  Walk through this opening and then north all the way ignoring 
the opening in the wall to your left.  Continue following the path north into 
the castle and you'll come to a set of stairs when the path turns right.  Go 
down the stairs and follow the hallway east and then north when you can.  Walk 
all the way up and down another staircase at the end.  This will put you in a 
secret room with a treasure chest containing the METEORITE ARMBAND accessory.  
As soon as you take it, though, a ghost will appear.  Speak with it and it will 
ask if you disturbed his slumber and took his treasure.  Reply YES to both 
questions and he will let you keep the Meteorite Armband because you were 
honest.  This item can be equiped by selecting USE when you have it selected in 
a character's inventory.  Whoever is &quot;equiped&quot; with this item will have their 
Agility stat doubled!  Very handy for a healer like a Pilgrim or even your 
Hero.

	Leave the way you came in and head straight into the castle once you 
get back outside.  There's not much you can do in the castle until you have the 
Magic Key, but we'll be getting that very soon.  When you talk with the people 
here you'll learn about the mysterious Pyramid to the north.  This place houses 
the Magic Key that we'll need.  Head upstairs and speak with the Queen here to 
save your game.  In the room to the east of the Queen's throne you'll find two 
children.  One of them sings a song about a secret to the doors of the Pyramid.
I'll cover this in depth once we get there.

	After saving and healing (if necessary), exit Isis and just fight 
around the area until you notice the monsters getting a bit easier for your 
party to handle.  The enemies you'll encounter in the Pyramid are fierce and 
if you plan on getting the Golden Claw for your Fighter, magic is not allowed!  
That being the case, be sure to stock up on plenty of Medical Herbs from the 
shops in Isis unless you plan to return to heal once you get the Magic Key.  
You may have noticed a shrine in the southern edge of the desert just southeast 
of Isis.  Inside you'll find an old man who will just inform you of the Pyramid 
and Isis, but that's no longer news to us.

	When you think you're ready to take on the Pyramid, save your game and 
travel directly north of Isis to find the Pyramid.

	There are a few things you should know about the Pyramid before we 
begin.  For one thing, a lot of the treasure chests you may find along the way 
are either empty or Man-Eater Chests.  The Man-Eater Chest is a monster that 
looks like a treasure chest but when searched it will attack.  Be cautious with 
them, though; they pack quite a punch.  My directions will lead you to the 
chests that actually contain items.  I'll leave it up to you whether or not you
want to fight those Man-Eater Chests.  Secondly, some of the floors have pits
that you can't see until you step over them.  Whenever you're walking, just be
sure to stick to the outside wall rather than walking straight through the
middle.

	Anyway, start off by walking directly north and you'll come to a tiny 
room where the path splits into three.  Continue walking north but stick to the 
outside wall of the room.  If you walk through the center a pit will open and 
you'll fall down into the basement and have to start all over.  Keep walking 
north and you'll come to another area with another pit in the center.  Avoid it 
by walking along the outside wall in a counter-clockwise manner and take the 
path on the right.  Follow this narrow path east into a small room with some 
green statues and then north.  Now just take this small passage to some stairs 
at the end.

	On the second floor, just walk all the way south and turn west once you 
hit the wall in the southern corner.  Soon you'll come to another set of stairs 
leading to the third floor.  Take these up.

	This is the place where the kids' song in Isis Castle comes in handy.  
From the stairs take the hallway to your right and when you get to the end it 
will split.  Walk down the right-most niche and you'll have an option to press 
a button.  Press the button and then return to the stairs you came from but 
take the hallway to the left.  At the end it will split like the other one but 
this time walk into the left-most niche and press the button here.  You should 
now get a message saying a boulder has moved.  Return to the stairs and walk 
all the way north into a room with two treasure chests.  The one on the left 
contains a VITALITY SEED and the other one has the MAGIC KEY!

	With this key, you'll now have the opportunity to get lots of treasure 
on the fourth floor of the Pyramid.  However, if your party is exhausted from 
the monsters in the here, cast Outside and return to Isis to heal.  Otherwise, 
return to the stairs that got you to this floor and take the hallway on your 
left again.  This time take the passage to the north before you reach the 
buttons and walk all the way up to a staircase.  Take this staircase to the 
fourth floor.

	Walk east from the stairs and you'll see a giant door below you.  Using 
your new Magic Key, open the door and you'll find yourself in a room with 12 
treasure chests surrounding a group of statues.  Before you go acting like a 
kid in a candy store, be aware that with each chest you open you'll have to 
battle four Mummy Men.  It's up to you whether or not you want to open all of 
them or just the ones that are most valuable to you at this point.  For your 
reference, here are the treasures that you'll find going in a clock-wise fashion
starting from the chest in the upper-left corner:  176G, 40G, STRENGTH SEED, 
80G, AGILITY SEED, 112G, 24G, 304G, WING OF WYVERN, 56G, MEDICAL HERB, 24G.

	After reaping all of the treasure you want, walk south of all the 
treasure chests and take the stairs up to the next floor.  Use your Magic Key 
to open the giant gray door above you and open the treasure chest you see here 
for some FLASHY CLOTHES (can only be worn by Goof-Offs).  Now walk up the stairs
to the east of the chest to find yourself on the very top of the Pyramid.  This 
top floor serves only one purpose: an immediate exit.  Just walk north and off 
the edge of the Pyramid to exit and then cast Return to Isis for some rest and 
relaxation.

	There's still one more treasure you can get in the Pyramid, but it's 
completely optional.  If you have a Fighter in your party, though, I'd highly 
recommend going for it since it's a really powerful weapon for them.  Even if 
you don't have a Fighter it'll put you at a huge advantage to get this weapon 
since you can sell it for 11250G coins!  I'm talking about the Golden Claw.  But
once you get your hands on it, your party will be cursed inside the Pyramid 
until you can escape.  By cursed, I mean you will not be allowed to use magic 
and the random encounters will increase a bit.  It's quite a price to pay in 
exchange for a powerful weapon, but it's still worth it.  Read below the dotted 
line if you wish to obtain this weapon.  Otherwise, skip this next sub-section.
You can always come back and get the Golden Claw later when you're party is a 
bit stronger if you need to.

--------------------------------THE GOLDEN CLAW---------------------------------

	After staying at the Inn in Isis, you'll want to head to the Tool Shop 
and buy enough Medical Herbs for the trip.  It's hard to say how many you'll 
need, but stock at least 1 or 2 character's inventories full of them just in 
case.  Once you've purchased as many as you think you'll need, return to the 
Pyramid.  Before you even move once you're inside, walk directly west so that 
you're walking along the outside edge of the base.  Keep walking and you'll see 
a staircase leading down into the basement.  Once you're in the basement, 
follow the narrow passage north and you'll find yourself in a larger room.  The 
basement has 4 rooms of which they are set up like so:  Upper-left, Upper-right,
Bottom-left, Bottom-right.  The first room you'll enter from the stairs is the 
bottom-left room.  From the entrance of this room, walk 7 steps east (from the </span><span id="faqspan-3">
end of the hallway you came from) and 4 steps north.  Search the ground here 
and you'll uncover a secret stairway!  This stairway leads down to a secret 
floor where the Golden Claw is kept.  Take the stairs and open the door you see 
with the Magic Key.  Follow this path all the way to the end and you'll find a 
casket.  Search the casket and you'll obtain the GOLDEN CLAW, but you're now 
cursed inside the Pyramid.

	Just fight your way back outside of the Pyramid going back the way you 
came.  Since you won't be able to use magic to heal, this is where the Medical 
Herbs come in handy.  Just keep everyone healthy and fight your way out.  Once 
you leave the Pyramid, though, the curse is gone and you can freely heal anyone 
you need to.

	Now that you have the Golden Claw, you can do what you please with it.  
Keep it in the Vault, equip it on your Fighter, sell it, whatever.  Keep in 
mind that if anyone in your party has the Golden Claw in their inventory, the
random enemy encounters sky-rocket; you'll be attacked just about every other
step.  Although this is incredibly inconvenient during your quest, it might not 
be a bad idea to keep it in the Vault for when you need to level grind later in 
the game.  Keep it, sell it, do whatever you like.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now that we've obtained the Magic Key, there's no need to keep the 
Thief's Key in your inventory because the Magic Key will open both Thief's Key 
doors (the yellow ones) and new doors (usually red).  Just put the Thief's Key 
in the Vault when you get the chance.  Also, there are some treasures that we 
can get to now that we couldn't before.  This next section will go through the 
towns and castles we've visited so far and list which treasures you can find 
with our new Magic Key.

	To begin our trip, cast Return to Aliahan and enter the castle.  Walk 
north on the first floor and make a left before you get to the guards by the 
stairs to the throne room.  Turn and go north after going through the opening 
in the wall and you'll see a small treasure room with a guard inside.  Open the 
red door with your Magic Key and open the six treasure chests for 128G, 336G, a 
FIGHTING SUIT, an AGILITY SEED, a STRENGTH SEED, and a WING OF WYVERN.

	If you return to Romaly, the only new door you can open with the Magic 
Key is on the first floor of the castle.  Head all the way to the back wall of 
the first floor and you'll notice a red door.  The only thing behind it is a 
small pond and a guy that mentions of a port city called Portoga where you 
might be able to get a ship.  This place will be the next place we visit on 
this quest.  But for now, let's keep searching for new treasure.

	In Assaram, you can head to the northwest corner of town and enter the 
building next to Merchant #1.  Unlock the door here and head up the stairs.  
The man standing near the pillars up here will tell you about a dwarf by the 
name of Norud who wouldn't let him have access to the land further east.  He 
mentions that he would only let friends pass through, like the King of Portoga, 
for instance.  If you enter Assaram at night, you can head over to the Theater 
and open the door in the southeast corner to find two people inside.  Although, 
they don't say anything you haven't already heard.  The dancer speaks about 
Norud the dwarf in the cave nearby and the guy next to her doesn't say anything 
important to the story.

	This leaves only one more place to visit; Isis.  Cast Return to Isis 
and enter the castle at night.  Walk north into the castle itself and head to 
the back wall of the first floor.  Along the back wall you'll see three red 
doors.  The doors in the northwest and northeast corner lead to a cluster of 
treasure chests.  Starting with the room in the top-left corner, you'll find 
four chests that, when opened, contain 72G, 64G, a WING OF WYVERN, and an 
INTELLIGENCE SEED.  In the room in the opposite corner, the four chests contain 
WAYFARER'S CLOTHES, ACORNS OF LIFE, 80G, and POISON MOTH POWDER.  Now head 
upstairs to the throne room and open the red door that you see on your left as 
you walk north.  Head upstairs to find yourself amongst a bunch of women in the 
Queen's Chamber... oops.  Speak with the Queen and she'll tell you to search all
around her.  Stand directly in front of her and search the ground to find a 
WIZARD'S RING.  This is a special item that restores a portion of a character's 
MP and has several uses before it breaks.  Just save this item for when you'll 
really need it.

	Now we can get back to the main quest.  After hearing all that talk 
about the lands to the east, Norud the dwarf, and a town called Portoga, you 
should have some sort of idea what we need to do next.  Return to Romaly and 
trek north a bit.  As soon as you get into the forest, turn and walk west 
several steps and you'll see a shrine within the mountains.  Enter this shrine 
and use your Magic Key on the door in front of you and take the stairs down.
Down on the basement floor, just walk to the left ignoring the jail door below 
you and head up the stairs on the opposite end.  Using your Magic Key again, 
exit the shrine and you'll find yourself in the region of Portoga.  From the 
shrine, just head south and follow the coast on your right down to Portoga.

N/A


	Enter the town and follow the walkway west a bit and then to the north.
You'll notice the path will turn again into the gray building.  Follow that 
walkway into the building and here you'll find the Tool Shop and Inn.  The 
counter across from the Tool Shop doesn't sell anything, but the man tells you 
that pepper is very valuable in Portoga.  Rest at the Inn if you need to then 
walk over to the far west across the water and you'll find Portoga Castle.  
Enter the castle and you'll notice a room in the center of the floor with three 
treasure chests surrounded by blue tiles.  Walk to the right and then north 
around this room and you'll see a door leading into the room.  Using either of 
your keys, open the door and make sure that your party is healed to the max 
before stepping on the blue tiles.  With each step you take on a blue square, 
your HP will be drained dramatically.  Just keep an eye on your HP with each 
step.  The three chests in here contain a SPIDER'S WEB, a VITALITY SEED, and 
88G.

	Now leave this room and head around to the left side of the castle.  
Follow the left path north to find the King.  When you speak with him, he'll 
ask that you travel to the east in search of some Black Pepper in exchange for 
a ship.  The King will then give you a ROYAL SCROLL that you need to show to 
Norud the dwarf in order to pass through the cave near Assaram.

	Return to Assaram and stay at the Inn if necessary, then leave and 
enter the cave just northeast of town along the mountains to the east.

	Follow the path east once you're inside and open the large door blocking
your way.  Continue moving east and then walk north once you get into the 
circular room.  A bit further up you'll find the dwarf you've heard so much 
about.  Before you speak to him, though, open the two treasure chests in the 
room for a TRAINING SUIT and a... CLUB.  If you just talk to Norud he'll tell 
you to leave.  Instead, stand in front of him and use the Royal Scroll the King 
of Portoga gave you.

	After reading the scroll to Norud, reply with a YES and then follow him 
back down where you came from.  He'll ask you to wait as he bashes down the 
wall below.  Now, just enter the new pathway he opened for you called Bolef's 
Path and take it all the way to the end where you'll find a staircase leading 
out to the other side of the mountains.

	From where you exited the cave, head far south and you'll come to a 
small desert area and green plains.  This is where you'll find our next town 
to visit.

WEAPONS/ARMOR SHOP:
-------------------
N/A


	Enter the town and check the place out.  With as many counters as you 
see, there's only one shop in town right now (the Tool Shop).  Stay at the Inn 
in the northeast corner of town if you need to, because I doubt that you 
wouldn't.

	If you walk south between the Tool Shop on the empty shop on the left 
towards the entrance of town, you'll see an old man and another guy in the 
sandy area.  Speak with the old man in green and he'll tell you about his 
granddaughter Tania that was kidnapped by a group of villains.  He then mentions
that the guy standing next to you is her lover, Galen.  Before the old man can 
even ask you for your help, Galen steps in and insists on saving her himself.  
After he takes off, speak with the old man again and he's obviously afraid that 
they'll both be captured now.

	Well, there's only one thing a hero can do: save them both!  Speak with 
the other citizens if you'd like and rest up if you haven't yet.  Then leave 
town and head across the bridge to the east.  Turn north once you cross the 
bridge and head into the forest area and soon you'll see another bridge leading 
back west.  Cross this bridge and you'll see a cave in the center of the 
forest.  Enter.

	You may notice something right away as you enter this cave and walk 
around.  All of the rooms look the exact same!  Well, you're not wrong, but for 
the sake of not getting lost, just follow me. :)

	From the entrance, walk to the left a little to enter the first room and
head all the way north through the next room.  When you get to the next room 
and walk all the way north, you'll feel something blocking your way.  Use either
of your keys to open the door you can't see into a room with two treasure 
chests.  The one on the right contains 552G coins but the one to the north is a 
Man-Eater Chest.  Now walk over to the next room on the left to find another 
chest with some FAIRY WATER.  Walk one more room over on the left to find 
yourself in yet another room with a couple treasure chests.  Open the one to 
the north for 232G and the chest on the far left for a MEDICAL HERB.

	Now, use your Magic Key to open the large door on the south end of 
this room and just walk all the way south (passing the guard you see) until you 
can't anymore and use your Magic Key on the door that you can't see.  In the 
next room, you can head to the room on the left to find another chest, but 
beware; it's a Man-Eater Chest.  However, if you walk all the way to the right 
(east), you'll eventually come to a room with a staircase leading further into 
the cave.  Take them down.

	On the bottom floor, walk all the way to the west and stand up against 
the black wall you see.  Use your Magic Key to unlock the door behind it and 
enter the room to find four treasure chests containing some ACORNS OF LIFE, a 
STRENGTH SEED, INTELLIGENCE SEED, and an AGILITY SEED!  Nice find.

	Return to the hallway you came from and take the southern path using 
your Magic Key when you get to the door.  Before you continue, make sure 
everyone's HP is healed to the max.  Continue walking south into a room with a 
bunch of henchmen.  When you approach them, they'll ask you to join.  Reply 
with a NO, of course, and they'll attack you!

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ! BOSS BATTLE ! |		       Kandar Henchmen (x4)                    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------+  I don't know if you'd really consider this a boss battle, |
| but don't underestimate these guys.  They're a little tougher than they were |
| during your last encounter.  The only thing you really need to do is have    |
| your Wizard cast Increase once or twice while everyone else attacks          |
| physically.  If you'd like you can have your Pilgrim cast SpeedUp, but by the|
| time you do that you'll pretty much cut down on the henchmen by 2 or 3.  Just|
| stay alive and keep hitting.  Not difficult at all.                          |
|                                                                              |
| Your party will be awarded 107 experience points when you defeat them.       |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	After defeating the henchmen, walk south and you'll find Tania and Galen
locked up in separate cells.  After Tania speaks, Galen will tell you that 
there's a switch next to the table nearby.  Walk south passed their cells and 
stand on the gray switch next to the table.  Select YES to release the couple 
from their cells and follow them after they run off together.  It looks like 
the kidnapper caught them just as they were about to escape.  It's Kandar!  
He recognizes you as you approach the scene and attacks.

| Henchmen HP: 60 |  It's best just to use the same tactics as the fight with  |
+-----------------+ the four henchmen.  Have your Hero and Soldier/Fighter     |
| attack physically while you cast SpeedUp and Increase a few times.  Take out |
| the two Kandar Henchmen first and then focus your attacks on Kandar himself. |
| Be sure to keep an eye on your HP and cast Healmore when necessary.  If your |
| Wizard has learned the Blazemore spell then utilize that as often as         |
| possible.  That'll knock off about 80 HP each time.  Just keep hacking away  |
| and healing when needed you shouldn't have any problem with this fight.      |
|                                                                              |
| When defeated, your party will earn 1654 experience points!                  |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Finally, Kandar realizes that you can pretty much kick his ass any day, 
so he promises to do good and begs for you to let him go.  Since you have no 
other choice, reply with a YES and he'll be on his way.  Cast Outside and 
return back to Baharata.

	When you get back to town, head to the shop southwest of the Tool Shop 
(the one that was empty before) and you'll notice that someone's behind the 
counter now.  It's Galen and as thanks for saving his life he'll hand over the
BLACK PEPPER!  You can head upstairs to find Tania and her grandfather who will 
thank you as well.

	Now let's return to Portoga and exchange the Black Pepper for a Ship!

	Cast Return to Portoga and enter the castle.  Speak with the king and 
he'll take the Black Pepper from you.  Now, when you exit the castle, you'll 
notice a ship right outside!  Climb aboard and sail south to leave Portoga.  
As soon as you're back on the world map, you'll notice a shrine directly south 
of you.  Sail up to the shrine, enter, and then head up stairs.  Here you'll 
find a man that will explain the layout of the land and mention of a town 
further south called Tedanki along with Jipang and Baharata.  He'll then mention
6 orbs that are scattered across the world that will allow you to reach places 
that a ship cannot.  Before we go on the quest for these orbs, there's still 
a few other places to visit that are VERY important.

	For now, cast Return to Baharata (your ship will follow you when you 
cast Return) and stay at the Inn to heal up if you haven't already.  From 
Baharata, walk east across the bridge and then turn north into the forest.  
Walk all the way north until you hit the river and follow the hills west and 
north around the lake to find Dhama Shrine.

	When you enter this huge shrine, speak with the man in blue that you 
see and he'll save your game.  This would be a perfect time to save if you plan 
on changing classes soon.  Walk all the way to the right and take the stairs 
that you see up to where you'll find an Inn for only 8G!  Talk about a bargain!

	Go back downstairs and open the large door next to the man in blue with 
your Magic Key.  Walk all the way north (speaking with the people along the 
way if you wish) and speak with the man on the platform.

	Here is where you are allowed to change character classes.  The only 
requirements to change classes is that the character must be level 20 or above.
It's entirely up to you whether or not you want to change any classes now, but 
you'll definitely want to make someone a Sage (preferably your Wizard or 
Pilgrim).  However, there is another requirement in order to become a Sage.  
Along with being level 20 or above, you must also obtain the Book of Satori.  
The Book of Satori can be found in a tower north of here called Garuna Tower, 
so that's our next destination.  Although, if, by some chance, you have a Goof-
Off in your party, at level 20 he or she can change into a Sage without the 
need of the Book of Satori.  But, assuming you don't have a Goof-Off, we'll have
to trek north and earn this item.

	Personally, I didn't change anyone's class the first time I set foot in 
Dhama.  If you have a Fighter, you may want to change them into a Soldier so 
that they'll have the agility and strength of a Fighter along with the HP and 
defence of a Soldier, but be aware that with any class change the character 
will drop back down to level 1.  Now before you freak out, realize that with 
the tougher enemies you've been encountering, getting them back up to your 
party's level won't take long.  Plus, they'll still keep some of their stats.

	Do what you wish for now and exit the Shrine of Dhama.  Head directly 
north and eventually you'll come to a tower.  This is the Tower of Garuna where 
we can find the item needed to become the ultimate Sage.

	Start off by walking west over the blue and white tiles and take the 
southwest path.  In the room to the left of the woman with purple hair you'll 
find a treasure chest with an INTELLIGENCE SEED.  Now return to the main room 
and make your way to the very northwest corner.  You'll notice an opening in the
wall that leads out onto the grass.  Walk just outside of the walls of the tower
and immediately turn left to find a lone staircase right on the outside of the
tower.  Take these stairs up and then walk east across the rope on the 2nd 
floor.  Take the stairs at the end back down to the first floor and walk west.  
Step on the blue portal here and you'll be teleported to an enclosed area with 
3 stairs to the north, south, and east ends.

	The stairs to the south will lead up to a Man-Eater Chest on the 3rd 
floor, so it's up to you whether or not you want to fight it.  The north 
staircase will lead up to a treasure chest on the 3rd floor with 248G coins.  
Now take the stairs on the east end directly across from the blue portal and 
then take the southern stairs on the next floor.  Head up two more floors and 
you'll see another rope leading across to the west.  Walk ALL the way across to 
the other side and take the stairs you see to the south into a tiny room with 
a chest containing an IRON HELMET.  Now return to the rope and walk back across
to the east but this time walk off to the south once you get to about the 
middle of the rope.  When you fall down, you'll land in an open area with a 
zig-zag pit.  Purposely fall down this pit and you'll land in a room on the 
floor below.  Head down the stairs on the west end of this room and you'll 
find yourself next to a chest in another room with a zig-zagged pit.  Open this 
chest to find what we came for; the BOOK OF SATORI!

	Now either cast Outside or fall down the pit here and exit the tower.  
Return to the Shrine of Dhama to heal and give the Book of Satori to whomever 
you want to turn into a Sage.  Just as long as they're level 20 or above, they 
are now eligable to become a Sage with the Book of Satori.  Speak with the 
man on the platform at the north end of the shrine and the Sage should now be 
on the list of classes to change into.  You might choose to turn your Wizard or
Pilgrim into a Sage, or you could go the route of turning a Solider/Fighter into
a Sage to give them a better advantage with HP, Strength, and Agility plus the
benefits of both a Wizard and a Pilgrim's spells.

	Now would be a good time to level up your Sage if you changed into one.
Just fight the enemies outside of Dhama and they'll level up in no time 
(especially since Metal Slimes roam the area).  Just get your Sage to about 
level 13 or 14.  By then, they should have some pretty decent spells (like 
Healmore).  Return to Dhama Shrine, save your game, and heal up at the Inn.

	Our next stop before we venture out on our ship is the village of Muor. 
Leave the Shrine of Dhama and start traveling east.  Follow the mountains 
southeast and turn north once you see a shrine to the east.  This is actually a 
traveler's Inn where you can stay a night for 60G coins.  Keep this is mind if 
you're ever nearby and in desperate need for healing.  Follow the open path 
between the two forests on either side of you all the way north until you 
eventually come to a small village near some frozen ground on the northern 
shore.  This is Muor.

	I'm sure by now you'll definitely need a rest from the trip up here, so 
stay a night at the Inn and then head over to the east side of town and enter 
the huge building via the south entrance.  In here is where you'll find the 
Tool Shop along with a Weapons/Armor Shop.  You should have quite a lot saved 
up since your last purchases, so don't hesitate to spend a hefty amount of it 
here.  Might I recommend the Staff of Judgment and the Iron Masks for your Hero
and Soldier?

	If you follow the path to the right of the Weapons/Armor Shop, you'll 
come to what looks like another shop of some sort, but when you speak to the 
man behind the counter he refers to you as Papagatero... huh?  He soon realizes 
that you're not him, though.  A few other citizens in town call you out as 
Papagatero as well.  Who is this guy?

	Exit the building via the way you entered but head to the left and 
around the to the back, hugging the left side of the building as you go up.  
Once you're in the very back, make sure you don't accidentally leave the village
by going too far north.  In the northeast corner of this building, head south 
into a room in the back.  You should see an old man in green sitting at a 
table (who also calls you Papagatero).  Enter the room south of him to find 
yourself behind the counter.  Go up the stairs and speak with the people sitting
in a circle in the next room.

	The young boy on the left, Popota, will hand over a very peculiar item 
called the WATER BLASTER.  This item can be used in front of people to squirt 
them with water, but it serves absolutely no other purpose as it cannot be 
equipped or used in battle.  I'd say put it in the Vault, but if you want to 
run around town squirting people, I say go for it!  You can also sell it for a 
whopping 15G coins.

	You'll also learn that the reason everybody's been calling you 
Papagatero is because he was your father and was known as Ortega in your 
hometown Aliahan.  Apparently, Ortega stumbled upon this village in his travels 
and the citizens became to know him very well.  Interesting.

	That's about all there is to Muor for now, so leave the village and 
cast Return to Portoga.  Remember what the man in the shrine south of Portoga 
said?  He talked about 6 orbs that can be used to create something that will 
take you places no ship can go.  Well, these orbs are more important than you 
may think.  It's now time to embark on a journey to (eventually) collect all 
6 orbs.  This journey begins in a village called Tedanki.

	Hop on your ship and sail south of Portoga, hugging the coastline of 
the continent to your right.  Just follow the coastline on the east all the 
way south until you come to a river with a bridge going across.  Continue 
sailing south passed the shrine you see and take the second river just south 
of it (the one not blocked by a bridge).  Sail down this river until it splits 
to the south and you'll see the town of Tedanki.

NOTE:  You may have notice a shrine NW of Tedanki on your way down.  Although 
       we can't use this shrine yet since we don't have the Final Key, remember
       this place for later because this shrine acts as a traveler's gate to the
       Inn near Jipang.  This gate makes it quicker and easier to reach Tedanki
       once we visit Jipang.

	Depending on what time of day you enter Tedanki will determine just 
how important or useless the town is.  During the day, it just looks like a 
broken-down abandoned place.  The only few things worth taking notice of during 
the day is the dead body in the jail cell at the north end of town.  Speak with 
the skeleton and you will point out a message that the prisoner wrote on the 
wall before he died.  Apparently, he was in possession of an orb and wanted to 
give it away when he was alive.

	If you head upstairs in the Weapons/Armor Shop northwest of the entrance
you'll find a skeleton laying in a bed.  Nearby is a chest containing the LAMP 
OF DARKNESS.  This item, when used outside of battle, will change the current 
time of day.  When used during the day, it will change to night.  This may come
in handy for something later, although if you'd like, you can put it in the
Vault for now.

	Enter Tedanki at night and the town will be flourishing.  Check out the 
weapons and armor shop northwest of the entrance and feast your eyes on some 
expensive (yet effective) equipment.  The Zombie Slasher is a great sword that 
has a critical effect on the undead type enemies.  The Magic Armor and Sacred 
Robe are also excellent pieces of armor.  Buy what you can, but don't fret if 
you can't afford much yet.  The Inn is quite expensive as well, but after 
several battles around the area you'd pay any amount for rejuvination.  Just be 
aware when you wake up it will be daylight again, so you'll have to wait until 
night falls before the citizens return.

	Visit the jail cell you saw during the day to find a guard outside of 
the cell.  It looks like the only way to get to the prisoner inside is through 
the jail door.  If you head east from the cell you'll find a large patch of 
poisonous ground.  Walk through this to the southeast to find an old man 
standing near some stairs.  Speak with him and he'll tell you about the Final 
Key and where it can be located.  This will be the next main item we find, 
because in order to obtain some of the orbs we'll need this key.

	That's about all there is to Tedanki for right now.  Be sure to come 
back at night once you have the Final Key and speak to the prisoner for the 
Green Orb.  Don't worry, I'll remind you again when that time comes.

	Our next stop is Lancel, where our quest for the Final Key begins.  The 
easiest way to get there is to cast Return to Aliahan and hop on your ship.  
Sail a ways southwest and then sail directly west of the Cave on the Promontory.
Keep sailing until you hit land.  You'll be on a large island and depending 
on where you actually land, Lancel will most likely be northwest of you near 
a circle of mountains.

	The main reason we're stopping at this village now is for the 
Invisibility Herb at the Tool Shop.  You can check out the other shops here or 
rest at the Inn, but if you just came from Tedanki the Weapons/Armor Shop here 
doesn't even compare.  If you walk east into an open grassy path just below the 
Weapons/Armor Shop you can walk far north behind all of the shops to find a 
giant shrine.  Wow, talk about hidden.  This is the entrance to a cave that 
holds the Blue Orb, but in order to get there we'll need the Final Key first.

	Rest at the Inn if you need to and then buy an Invisibility Herb (or 
two) from the Tool Shop for 300G coins.  Leave Lancel and cast Return to 
Portoga.  Get on your ship and sail west around the coast and then north when 
you can.  Sail far north of Portoga and eventually you'll hit a smaller island 
with a castle on it.  Enter.

	Walk north into the castle and try to get pass the guard.  Seems like 
he won't let you through because the King doesn't want anymore &quot;Yokels&quot;... 
alrighty then.  Now's the time to use your Invisibility Herb.  Sprinkle the 
Herb on your party and you'll become invisible momentarily.  Now's your chance 
to walk pass the guard and into the castle.  If you'd like, you can mess around 
with the people inside and speak to them while you're still invisible.  It's 
funny what some people say. :)

	When the invisibility wears off, walk around and speak with the citizens
of the castle.  Most of them will be talking about either the Final Key, the 
Shrine in the Shoals, or how to rearrange the boulders in the basement to solve 
a puzzle.  This puzzle that you hear of is the reason we came here.  On the 
first floor of the castle, head down the stairs in the west side enclosed by a 
wall.  You may want to head upstairs and speak with the King to save your game 
first, but I'll leave that up to you.

	Down in the basement is where you'll find 3 boulders in a row near 
patches of water.  The object of this puzzle is to get all 3 boulders onto the 
blue and white tiles in the room above.  If you'd like to figure this puzzle 
out on your own, skip the next section.  If you quickly want to get it over 
with, here's the solution:

1.  Move the boulder on the far left UP 1
2.  Move the boulder on the far right DOWN 1.
3.  Move the boulder in the middle LEFT 1.
4.  Move the boulder on the far left LEFT 1.
5.  Go around the water and move the boulder on the far left RIGHT 3.
6.  Go around and move the boulder on the far right UP 1.
7.  Push the boulder on the far right (the one you just moved) DOWN 1.
8.  Move the new boulder in the middle up to any of the tiles in the small room.

Two boulders should remain:

1.  Move the boulder on the left LEFT 1.
2.  Go around the water to the left and move the left boulder UP 1.
3.  Push the left boulder RIGHT 2 and then up onto one of the tiles in the room.

One boulder left:

1.  Push this boulder UP 1.
2.  Move the boulder LEFT 4.
3.  Go around and move it UP 1.
4.  Now move the boulder RIGHT 2 and up onto the last remaining tile.

	An opening will form in the wall to the right once all 3 boulders are 
on the tiles.  Enter and follow this hallway down to a chest containing the 
VASE OF DROUGHT.  This item will make the Shrine in the Shoals appear and lead 
us to the Final Key.  Once you've obtained the Vase of Drought, leave Eginbear 
and cast Return to Aliahan.

	Once you've returned to Aliahan, get on your ship and sail directly 
south of Aliahan.  Keep sailing and sailing and eventually you'll come to a 
cluster of rocks in the ocean with a formation like so:

                                       *
                                      ***

	It'll take you a long time to find them, but if you just sail south 
from Aliahan they'll come into view eventually.  All you have to do is sail 
up against one of the rocks and use your Vase of Drought.  This will reveal the 
Shrine in the Shoals.  Enter.

	Now just walk up to the treasure chest in the center of the shrine and 
open it to find the FINAL KEY!  You can walk north of the chest and open up one 
of the gray doors and speak with the skeleton sitting on the throne if you 
want.  He just mentions the Pit of Giaga and Necrogond which will be important 
later on in the game.

	For now, though, we can use the Final Key to obtain one of the six orbs
we need.  Also, with the Final Key in hand, you can put the Magic Key and the 
Vase of Drought in the Vault to make some space in your inventory.  The Final 
Key has the ability to open any and all doors for the rest of the game, so the 
Magic Key is useless.

	Return to Tedanki and enter the town at night.  Head all the way to the 
north side of the town and open the jail door where the prisoner is being held.
Speak with him and he'll hand over the GREEN ORB without any hesitation.  Wow, 
that was easy!

	The next stop on our quest is the Tower of Arp.  In here lies a special 
item that can help you pin-point the location of the remaining orbs.  The item 
I speak of is the Echoing Flute.  In order to find this tower, cast Return to 
the Shrine of Dhama and hop on your ship.  Follow the river southeast until you 
hit the ocean and then sail directly east until you hit a large mass of land.  
From here, sail all the way north until you hit land again and you should see 
a tower in view.  Enter the Tower of Arp.

	From the entrance, just walk north past the group of pillars and open 
the large door with your Final Key.  Now take either the east or west path 
(it doesn't matter) and open another door along the way.  Keep moving forward 
and you'll come to another large door below you.  Open this door and walk into 
the room where you'll find a cluster of four staircases.  Take the stairs in 
the top left corner to the next floor.

	On the second floor, Just take the path to the left and follow it up to 
a room with another set of stairs.  Take these up to the third floor and then 
take the next staircase you see on your immediate right up to the fourth floor.

	Walk east along the upper wall taking care not to fall down the pit.  
Take the stairs leading up to the fifth floor and you'll find yourself amongst 
a bunch of ropes.  Take one of the ropes directly below you to find a Man-Eater 
Chest if you want the experience and gold.  Now walk a bit to the left and 
you'll see two more treasure chests in the southwest corner of the tower.  
Cross the appropriate ropes and open the chest along the bottom wall for some 
CLOTHES, but the chest along the left wall is another Man-Eater Chest.

	Now walk along the ropes to the very center of the tower and fall down 
the pit that's shaped like the largest square (it's in the very center).  If 
you dropped down the right pit, you should land on a small platform with four 
treasure chests on the floor below.  Open all of them to find some ACORNS OF 
LIFE, the ECHOING FLUTE, 552G pieces, and another ACORNS OF LIFE!

	Having possession of the Echoing Flute might make your search for the 
remaining orbs easier.  When an orb is nearby and you use the flute, it will 
ring.  Personally, though, I never used it.  I just decided to go through the 
tower just for the treasure and to gain some experience and gold from the 
battles.

	Cast Outside and then cast Return to the Shrine of Dhama.  Get on your 
ship and sail southeast down the river like you did when you were going to the 
Tower of Arp.  You'll notice a small island with a village and a cave on it 
once you hit the ocean (you probably saw it when you were heading to the Tower 
of Arp).  Land on the island and enter the village.

	Enter the village and speak to everyone.  You'll learn of a terrifying 
beast called Orochi that takes female human offerings in return for letting the
villagers live in peace.  Otherwise, he'll devour and kill everyone.  You'll 
also hear about a man by the name of Himiko who is vexed by this beast.

	Apparently, a girl by the name of Yayoi is the next offering.  You can
find her in an underground storage room if you enter the small building on the 
southwest corner of town.  Search the pot in the northeast corner to find her.
You don't have to do this but it's pretty interesting. :)

	If you head all the way to the north end of tower you can enter Himiko's
fortress.  Speak with the people inside to learn more about him.  You can also 
speak to Himiko himself in his chamber, but he doesn't say much right now.

	Our next objective is to slay this Orochi and bring ease to Jipang, but 
before we do make sure to stay at the traveler's inn just northwest of Jipang.  
It's the one you passed on your way to Muor from Dhama Shrine.  You may even 
want to head over to Dhama so you can save your game.  Once you're all rested 
and ready to go, enter the cave right outside of Jipang.

	Start off by taking the passage to the west and follow it once it turns 
south.  Continue walking south ignoring the paths to your left and right.  When 
the path splits, take the left passage way and follow that south and then east.
When you see an opening to the north, take it and keep walking north until you 
see a set of stairs.  Pass the stairs for now and walk east of them into a 
darkened room with a treasure chest.  Open the chest for a NOH MASK.  Be careful
not to equip it, though, for it is a cursed item and can only be removed if you 
visit a temple.  Just keep it for now and sell it when you get the chance.  Now 
go back and take the stairs you saw down to the floor below.

	Head north and take a right at the 4-way intersection.  Cross the long 
bridge over the lava and maneuver east around the rocks.  You'll notice a 
dragon-like monster at the end.  I smell a boss fight.

	Make sure you heal everyone's HP to the max and confront the beast to 
engage in battle with...

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ! BOSS BATTLE ! |                           Orochi                           |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| HP: 300         |                                                            |
+-----------------+  A good way to start the battle is to have your Hero and   |
| Solider or Fighter attack physically and your Pilgrim/Wizard/Sage use spells |
| like Sap, SpeedUp, and Increase.  Orochi has the ability to attack twice per |
| round, and on top of that, it also has a fire-breathing attack that can be   |
| deadly so you will definitely want to keep an eye on your HP.  Sap will allow|
| your party to hit up to about 80 damage per person, so this should help speed|
| the fight along.  After every 2 or 3 rounds, you may want to spend the next  |
| one just casting Healmore and such; you can't be too careful.  If you're     |
| unlucky like me and notice that he's attacking with his fire-breathing attack|
| twice each round (totaling over 60 damage for each character), then bounce   |
| back with several Healmore spells.  He should go down pretty easily, but if  |
| you're finding that his attacks are just too intense for you, there's no     |
| shame in leveling up a few more levels and trying again.                     |
|                                                                              |
| Your party will gain 2680 experience points, 240G pieces, and an OROCHI      |
| SWORD for winning this fight!                                                |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Unfortunately, the Orochi Sword isn't as powerful as the Zombie Slasher 
if you have one, but hang onto it anyway.  When used in battle, it has a special
effect.

	Follow Orochi into the red warp pad and you'll find yourself back in 
Jipang.  It seems like Himiko is badly wounded.  Could it be that Himiko's true 
identity is Orochi?  Before you even approach him, leave Jipang and REST AT AN 
INN!  After the previous fight with Orochi, your party is bound to be in bad 
shape.  Just rest at the traveler's Inn northwest of Jipang on the mainland and 
return here to speak with Himiko.  Reply with a NO when he asks you to keep 
quiet about his true identity and you'll be forced to fight him again!

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ! BOSS BATTLE ! |                      Orochi (rematch)                      |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| HP: 300         |                                                            |
+-----------------+  It may seem like he hasn't changed at all, but in fact he |
| can now regenerate some HP after each round.  Start this battle the same way |
| you did with the previous one.  The only difference about this fight is that |
| Orochi seems to always attack with its deadly fire, meaning all your party   |
| members can lose about 70 HP per round.  Make sure you cast Increase 2 or    |
| 3 times and use Bikill on your strongest attackers if you have it.  If you   |
| have a free turn (when you're not healing), SpeedUp won't hurt either.  Just |
| use the same tactics as the previous fight and you should come out alive.    |
| HEALMORE, HEALMORE, HEALMORE!                                                |
|                                                                              |
| Your party will gain another 2680 experience points and 240G pieces when you |
| defeat him.                                                                  |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	After the battle, search the chest in Himiko's place to find the PURPLE
ORB!  Two down, four to go.  Leave the village (you can speak with some of the 
people if you'd like) and make sure to rest up again at an Inn.  I barely made 
it out of this fight with everyone alive and I was level 26.

	When you're all set to continue, cast Return to Lancel and head back to 
the giant shrine behind the village.  Use your Final Key to open one of the 
three gray doors and head into the shrine.  Make sure your Hero has full HP and 
MP and that his/her inventory is as empty as possible.  Other than equipment 
and the Final Key, your Hero shouldn't have anything else.  The reason for this
is that you will only be able to control the Hero in this next dungeon, so any
items you obtain from treasure chests you won't be able to keep unless there is 
space.  Speak with the old man in the back.  He'll ask you if you would like to
try your courage.  Reply YES and follow the old man into the back.  Exit the
shrine via the left passage and enter the cave in the center of the desert once
you exit.

NOTE:  If you die in this dungeon you'll simply have to start over but you won't
       lose any of your hard-earned money.  In other words, don't reset if you
       get KO'd in the Navel of the Earth; you can keep trying until you get 
       all the treasure.

	In this dungeon you will only have control of your Hero, so proceed 
with caution.  Conserve as much MP as possible for Heal.  Start off by going 
south from the entrance passing all of the skull statues on the way.  Use your 
Final Key to open the large wooden door blocking your path and continue heading 
south through the next room.  When you step into the darkened area, walk over 
to the small hallway on the left and take it down to find a chest containing 
248G pieces.  Return to the previous room and enter the small hallway on the 
opposite side (right side) and follow it into a room with another treasure 
chest.  Be careful, though.  This chest is a Mimic (a stronger version of the 
Man-Eater Chest).  If I were you, I wouldn't even bother fighting it because 
they hit extremely hard and can cast all kinds of wicked spells (like Sleep and 
more importantly, Defeat).

	Return to the main room with all of the stone pillars and walk a bit 
further south.  There will be two more passage ways on either side of the room 
that lead to two more treasure chests.  The room on the right contains an 
INTELLIGENCE SEED, and the room on the left houses another Mimic!  Head south 
from the stone pillars in the main room and enter the next area.  Just follow 
this path east to a set of stairs leading down to the floor below.

	You'll notice that this next floor is very empty and it's easy to get 
lost.  From the stairs, walk east 21 steps and then walk directly north and up 
the stairs you come to.  On the next floor, just follow the path west, south, 
and then east into a room with a treasure chest containing the ARMOR OF 
TERRAFIRMA.  Return to the giant open room and from the stairs, just walk 
directly north and you should see another set of stairs leading down.  Take 
these stairs down to the last floor.

	On the bottom floor, walk west from the stairs and turn north at the 
split.  Follow this path around as it turns to the left ignoring what all of 
the faces on the walls say.  Eventually, you'll turn south and then east.  
At the end of the hallway you'll come to a room with two giant statues and two 
treasure chests.  Open both of the chests for a MEDICAL HERB and the BLUE ORB!

	You're now free to cast Outside and return to Lancel.  If you were 
forced to leave some of the items in the dungeon behind, you can always come 
back after transfering some of your Hero's items to other party members so that 
you'll have room.

	Upon your return to Lancel's shrine, you will be reunited with your 
party and you can be on your way.  With three out of six orbs in your 
possession, you're one step closer to finishing your search.  The next orb that 
we will be getting, the Red Orb, is probably the easiest one to obtain.

	Cast Return to Aliahan and hop on your ship.  Sail south until you hit 
the ocean and then follow the coastline east until the shrine near the Cave of 
Enticement is to your left.  From here, sail east until you hit land on another
continent.  Head north from where you land and you'll notice a small village 
outside of the trees.  This is the House of Pirates.

	If you enter during the day, the giant pirate house will be empty.  Not 
until you speak to the man in the underground cell inside the house will you 
learn that the pirates don't show up until night.  Regardless of what time of 
day it is, though, the only important thing here is the Red Orb.  Where could 
it possibly be, might you ask?  If you follow the outside of the house to the 
right of the entrance you'll come to a boulder sitting in a sandy area.  Move 
the boulder aside and search the ground where it was to uncover a hidden 
stairway!

	Down here you'll find 3 treasure chests containing the RED ORB, a 
STRENGTH SEED, and a WING OF WYVERN.  You can come back at night if you want to 
talk to the pirates (c'mon, who doesn't want to meet a pirate?), but it's not 
entirely necessary.  The next place we can visit is a town called Luzami.  The 
boss of the pirates mentions that this town is on a tiny island in the 
southwest.  Get back on your ship and sail a ways south and then to the west a 
bit.  It's not hard to pass this town up because it's in such a discrete 
location.

	There isn't a whole lot to this quiet place.  You'll learn more about 
a man named Simon who wielded the Sword of Gaia and the where-abouts of the 
Archfiend's Castle.  In the northern part of town you'll find a tombstone 
surrounded by a bunch of flowers.  If you stand in front of the tombstone and 
search the ground you'll find an INTELLIGENCE SEED.

	Other than that there's not much else.  I just figured that while we 
were in the area we might as well check out this forgotten island.  You have to 
admit, it can easily be missed.

	Make your back northeast to the House of Pirates but stay on your ship.
If you continue to follow the eastern coastline of this continent north you'll 
eventually hit some mountains and a river blocked by rocks on the northern 
side.  Sail directly north of this river and you'll hit the bottom of the 
northern continent.  Sail up the river that empties into the ocean and make a 
left at the fork (but not the very first left you see).  Make the next left and 
then turn north when you can.  Follow this stream up and a village should come 
into view soon.  Make a right at the next juncture and then continue north and 
around to land right outside the village of Soo.

	Welcome to the settlement of the Soo tribe.  Walk around and speak to 
the locals and stay at the Inn if you need to.  In the center of town, search 
the ground on the south side of the well to find a STAFF OF THUNDER.  You'll 
hear a lot of talk about the Echoing Flute, the Tower of Arp and the Vase of 
Drought, but lucky you we've already been there. :)

	Take a look at the shops if you want and leave the village.  Our next 
destination will ultimately lead us to the Yellow Orb.  If you back track down 
the crazy river the way you came, you'll end up back in the ocean.  Sail east 
from the mouth of the river and then north around the mountains.  Hug the 
eastern coastline of the continent as you travel all the way north and you'll 
eventually come across a small forest area with an open square inside.  Land 
your ship and step onto this grassy patch to discover a new... town?

	Enter the small building south of the pond and speak to the old man 
you see here.  He mentions that he plans on building a new town here, but he'll 
need some merchants.  Return to Aliahan and enter Luisa's Place to register a 
Merchant.  Drop one of your current party members off at Luisa's and recruit 
the new Merchant you just made.  Now, return to the old man at the empty town 
and speak with him again.  If your Merchant dies during the trip back, just 
use Vivify on him until he is resurrected.

	Reply with a YES when he asks your Merchant if he or she would like to 
take the job.  Say YES again as comfirmation and the Merchant will leave your 
party to help the old man build the town.  Speak with both of them afterwards 
and then leave.  Re-enter again and speak with your Merchant north of the pond.
He looks different, but it's him alright.  He mentions that he'll be building 
a shop in that spot.

	Leave town and return to Aliahan.  You can now recruit your other party
member that you left at Luisa's Place.  Cast Return to Soo and make your way 
back to the town (it's the quickest way).  By the time you get there, it'll 
probably be night.  If not, use your Lamp of Darkness and enter the town.  The 
shop your Merchant said he was going to build should be up now.  Speak to the 
old man in his house and then leave.  Walk around outside until the sun comes 
up and head back inside.  Somehow, over night, the town began to flourish!  
Speak with everyone in town including your Merchant who is building a new 
theater.  There's also a new Tool Shop just north of the pond in the center of
town and an Inn just east of the shop.  Make sure you don't forget the old man
upstairs in his house.

	What we need to do now is continue with our quest in order to give the 
town time to expand further.  With that said, in this little section below I 
will be speaking as if you have already completed 'Mirror of Ra and the Staff 
of Change' as well as the 'A Lover's Memento' sections.  Once you have gotten 
that far, return to your Merchant's town and you will be able to obtain the 
Yellow Orb.  But for now, skip the dotted-lined section.

----------------------------------THE YELLOW ORB--------------------------------

	When you're ready to get the Yellow Orb, return to Portoga and hop on 
your ship.  Sail west of Portoga until you hit land, and then follow the coast 
north to find your town.  Enter and you'll notice that a lot has changed!  The 
Inn is a lot more expensive and the Weapons/Armor shop sells some pretty nice 
equipment.  In fact, if you're about to take on the Cave of Necrogond, this is 
the best place to purchase your equipment at this point in the game.

	Walk around and talk to everyone.  The old man that started the town 
can be found on the west side of the pond in the center.  It seems like your 
Merchant has been working the townfolk a little too hard and people are starting
to rebel.  Not good.

	You can find your Merchant in the large house in the northwest corner 
of town.  Enter and speak with him/her and then open the 2 chests on either side
for 240G pieces and a rare LUCK SEED.  Leave the town and walk around until 
night falls (or use your Lamp of Darkness if you still have it with you) and 
then re-enter the town.  Head over to the southwest corner of town and enter 
the jail.  It seems like your Merchant was over-thrown by the citizens and 
thrown in jail!  Speak with him through the bars and he'll tell you to search 
behind the chair in his house.  Walk north to his house and search directly 
behind the chair to uncover the YELLOW ORB!  Oh, and don't bother opening the 
treasure chests again.  If you opened them earlier they'll be empty. ;)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Leave your Merchant's town and get back on your ship.  Sail north as 
you continue to hug the coastline and when you get to the northern tip you'll 
notice an island partially covered in ice.  Land your ship here and enter the 
shrine in the center.  This is a traveler's gate that has 3 warp portals that 
will teleport you to different places in the world.  The portal on the left will
transport you to the gate between Romaly and Portoga, the one to the north will
take you to the Promotory of Olivia which we will be visiting later, and the 
portal on the right will teleport you to the Samanao region.  This is the one 
we want to take.

	Step onto the blue warp and use your Final Key to open the door.  Exit 
the shrine you're in and head north.  Cross the bridge over the river and 
continue traveling west.  Turn south and follow the open path between the 
forests and you'll soon find Samanao Castle.

	Enter town and walk east a bit to witness a burial taking place in the 
graveyard.  Speak with the people around the casket and you'll learn that a 
man by the name of Baranao was killed for bad-mouthing the King!  Wow, that's a 
pretty harsh punishment.  The rest of the town's citizens also speak of how 
the King has recently been very defensive and has been executing people for the 
smallest things.

	Explore the rest of the town.  You can head downstairs in a small
building below the graveyard to find another monster battle arena.  Try your 
luck there if you're feeling up to it.  The weapons and armor shop is upstairs 
in the building across from the battle arena.  Most of the equipment is stuff 
you've seen elsewhere, but the Silver Shield is something you'll want to 
purchase for everyone if you can afford it.  Also, if you have the money to 
blow, you can get a Dragon Killer for your Soldier if you have one.

	Head to the southwest corner of town and you'll find the castle.  Enter 
the castle and speak with one of the two guards blocking the entrance.  It 
seems that no matter what you say they won't let you inside.  Head to the right
on the grass just outside the walls and then follow it north.  Open the red 
door you see and walk inside.  Walk south and use your Final Key to open the 
door here and you'll find yourself in the main area of the castle.

	Walk towards the center of the first floor and speak with the King.  
Before you can even completely approach him, he'll call you out and summon the 
guards to throw you in jail.  After the guard takes you down to the basement 
and puts you in a cell, use your Final Key to escape.  Obviously, he's not a 
very smart guard or else he would have searched you before tossing you in jail.

	Exit the cell and head to the right down the hallway.  Open the door 
on the far right end and walk south and down the stairs to exit.  You'll find 
yourself on another floor underneath the castle where the REAL King is being 
detained!  Use your key to open his cell and speak with him.  Seems as though 
someone stole his Staff of Change and assumed his identity.  Hmmm, I wonder who 
it could be...

	Open the jail cell across from the King's and push against the dark wall
on the left side to find a secret passage way.  Follow this all the way to the 
end and up the stairs to find yourself outside the castle in the town's 
graveyard.

	Well, now that we've escaped and talked to the real King about the 
situation, we need to find an item of some sort that will reveal the imposter's 
identity.  Just southeast of Samanao you'll find a cave surrounded by poisonous
ground.  Cross the bridge and enter the cave.

	Start by moving west from the entrance and head up the north passage 
when you can.  When you get to the pond, turn and walk west down the passage 
way and then make the first turn south to a stairway leading further into the 
cave.

	On this floor you'll find tons of treasure.  However, a good majority 
of it is Mimics, so be careful.  The treasure chest nearest you contains 128G 
pieces, and the chest next to that has a STRENGTH SEED.  As you continue to 
move west, the next chest houses 56G coins and the one after that has a WING OF
WYVERN.  The trail of treasure chests will then begin to turn north.  In order,
the rest of them contain 568G pieces, 24G pieces, ACORNS OF LIFE.  Now turning 
east into the hallway; MEDICAL HERB, 320G pieces.  You'll now be in a small 
room with 4 treasure chests in four different corners.  Be cautious, though.  
Each one of them is a Mimic!

	Now back track to the large open room and head south from about the 
middle chest.  Enter the dark hallway and follow it east.  When you get to a 
fork, take the northern path and open some treasure chests along the way for a 
VITALITY SEED, 24G pieces, and a MEDICAL HERB.  At the end you'll enter a small
room with 2 treasure chests that each contain Mimics.

	Now return to the fork in the path and take the southern one and follow 
it further east.  When you see a passage to the north, take it and open the 
chest along the way for a Mimic (take it or leave it).  Then, enter the room 
above and open the chest on the right for a STONE OF LIFE (the chest on the left
is another Mimic).  Go back and continue taking the passage way east into a 
room with a set of stairs leading down.  Take these.

	Walk west and then follow the path north.  Soon you'll come to a
treasure chest on your right with an ANIMAL SUIT.  Go back to the stairs you 
came from and take them back to the previous floor.  Back track to the large 
open room with all of the treasure chests and head to the southeast corner of 
this room.  There's a pit in the dead end that will drop you down to a chest on 
the floor below that contains the MIRROR OF RA.  This is what we came for.

	Once you've snatched the Mirror of Ra, cast Outside and let's get out of
here!  Return to Samanao and rest at the Inn then use your Lamp of Darkness to 
pass the time to night.  If you don't have the lamp with you, you'll have to 
walk around outside until the sun sets.  I advise against this, however, because
you'll be fighting random battles and you'll need full HP and MP soon for a 
boss fight.  And if you rest at an Inn at night, when you wake it'll be day 
(duh).

	When you enter Samanao at night, head to the castle and enter through 
the side entrance like you did before.  On the first floor, head all the way 
to the northeast corner of the castle and up the stairs.  Walk up the next 
couple sets of stairs and then walk off one of the openings at the top of the 
tower.  You'll then fall down onto the roof of the castle where you'll see the 
King asleep in his chamber.  Enter through one of the openings in the back and 
stand in front of the King.  Use the Mirror of Ra and the King's true identity 
will be revealed.  A giant... troll?!

+-----------------+  You can end this battle in one or two rounds if you want. |
| All I did was have my Hero use his Zap spell, my Soldier attack, my Pilgrim  |
| use Sap, and my Sage use Bikill on the Soldier.  This allowed my Soldier to  |
| do over 230 damage in the first round, with an additional 72 damage from my  |
| Hero's Zap.  This took the Boss Troll out in one round.  However, if you     |
| aren't that lucky just be sure to watch your HP and keep Bikill up.  This    |
| really isn't any different from the previous boss fights.  It should all be  |
| routine now.                                                                 |

| Your party will gain 834 experience points and 126G coins for defeating the  |
| Boss Troll.                                                                  |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	After the battle, open the chest behind the King's bed for the STAFF OF 
CHANGE and then jump off the edge of the castle.  Re-enter and you'll no longer
have to worry about avoiding the guards or being thrown in jail.  The real King
is back and people are much more friendly.  Now's a good time to speak with the
King and save your game.

	The Staff of Change is the first item we need to start tracking down 
the Sword of Gaia, which is the item we'll need to open the path to Necrogond.
First, though, we can have some fun with it.  If you return to the Elf Village 
near Noaniels, you can use the Staff of Change to turn your party into elves.  
Just keep using the Staff of Change until your party turns into short guys with 
beards and green clothing.  Now, you can view the items at the Tool Shop!  There
are a couple things to take note of.  Buy several Wizard's Rings if you can 
because you may need them for much later when you won't have the ability to 
restore MP at an Inn.  Also, the Angel's Robe is a decent piece of armor for 
your Pilgrim or Sage.  You might as well stock up on what you can, because once
we get rid of the Staff of Change you won't have another opportunity to purchase
anything from this shop!

	Once you've had your fun, you must deliver the Staff of Change to an 
old man on an icy island to the north called Greenlad.  One simple way to get
there is to cast Return to Portoga and get on your ship.  Sail directly west 
and eventually you'll hit land around where your Merchant's town is.  Sail 
north while hugging the coastline to your left and you'll come to the small 
island with the traveler's gate on it that you took to get to Samanao.  Head 
north from this shrine and you'll land on Greenlad.  Look for a grassy patch in
the ice as you travel west on the island and step onto it.

	Head all the way north once you're inside even though it may seem like 
there's absolutely nothing here.  Eventually you'll see a small house.  Enter 
the house and speak with the old man inside.  He'll ask to trade your Staff of 
Change for a Sailor's Thigh Bone.  Hmmm... okay?

	Reply YES and he'll hand over the SAILOR'S THIGH BONE for your Staff of
Change.  When you use the bone, it'll give you a different direction each time.
Leave Greenlad and get on your ship.  Sail around and keep using the Sailor's 
Thigh Bone every so often and follow the directions it gives.  Eventually, it 
will lead you to a Phantom Ship sailing around in the ocean by itself!  Sail up
to the ship to board it.

TIP:  The Phantom Ship can usually be found close to Romaly.  Cast Return to 
Romaly and board your ship and sail around using the bone every once in a while
and you should find it pretty quick.

	Once you're on board, head towards the center and then go south (ignore 
the set of stairs in the middle).  You'll see a monster standing across from a 
staircase leading down into the lower deck.  If you speak to the monster, you'll
engage in battle with a Minidemon.  No big deal, but if you want to ignore him 
you can.  Take the stairs down to the lower deck.

	Head south from the stairs and enter the room below the cabin with the 
door and you'll find a treasure chest.  Open it up to find the LOCKET OF LOVE.  
This is the main item we came for, but there are a few other treasures we can 
snag while we're here.  Enter the room above this one using your Final Key to 
open the door and you'll find 5 chests in the northwest corner.  Open them up 
for 144G pieces, 136G pieces, 128G pieces, a Mimic, and a FULL MOON HERB.

	That's all there is to be found on the Phantom Ship.  You can speak with
some of the dead sailors and the slaves below deck if you wish.  The next thing 
we need to do is head over to the Promontory of Olivia to summon the two lovers'
spirits to be reunited.

	The Promontory of Olivia is located far east of Kanave.  The easiest 
way to get there is to cast Return to Noaniels and board your ship.  Begin by
sailing east as you stay near the coast.  Keep going all the way east as you 
pass several ice caps and you'll soon notice a river to the south that's blocked
by rocks.  Pass up this river and keep sailing east and you'll start to move 
southeast as you continue to follow the coastline.  At the end of the frozen 
peninsula, turn directly south and you'll notice another river leading west into
the mainland with a shrine nearby.  Land here and enter the shrine to speak with
the man inside.  He mentions that at one point he fought along side Ortega and 
that Ortega met his demise when he fell into a volcanic crater... ouch!

	Leave the shrine and travel south into a HUGE forest.  If you keep 
moving south you'll spot a lonely mountain peak in the middle of the trees.  
Stand directly below it and continue walking south for 9 steps.  Search the 
ground once you get to this spot and you'll find a LEAF OF THE WORLD TREE.  
This item, when used in battle, acts like the Revive spell.  It will bring a 
fallen party member back to life with full HP.  Be advised, though, that you 
can only carry one at a time.  When you use a Leaf of the World Tree, you can 
return to this spot to find another one.

	Head all the way back north and get on your ship.  Sail down the river 
going in the general southwest direction and you'll reach a lake in the center 
of the continent.  Continue moving south and west a little and attempt to sail 
through the canal between the two land masses just above the shrine you see.  
Suddenly a voice will push your ship back.  As soon as you're pushed back, use 
your Locket of Love (make sure you don't move from the spot that you're pushed 
back into).

	Suddenly the spirits of Errol and Olivia will speak and be reunited.  
After you've broken Olivia's curse, sail west through the canal again into the 
other lake and land your ship on the small island with a shrine.  This is the 
Shrine Jail.

	This is a pretty depressing place if you ask me.  Just walk all the way 
south and enter the room on the right where you'll see a corpse lying in bed.  
Search the foot of the bed in front of Simon's body and you'll find the SWORD OF
GAIA.  This is the item we need to enter the region of Necrogond and make our 
way to Baramos' Castle.  It's not a very good weapon to equip and fight with in 
battle, so don't even bother.

	Assuming you have all of the orbs except for the Silver Orb, we're 
ready to enter the region of Necrogond.  Make sure you have the Sword of Gaia 
in your inventory and that you've saved your game, then cast Return to Assaram.
Get on your ship and sail south down the river.  When you get to the fork, 
turn and go northwest up the other joining side of the river and then take the 
narrow stream south between the mountains.  Land your ship at the end and walk 
up to the giant black hole in the ground.  Stand in front of it and use the 
Sword of Gaia from your inventory to hurl the sword into the crater.  Watch the
amazing animation (sarcasm) and then go around and cross over the new land that
the volcano created to reach the land of Necrogond in the south.

	Continue traveling south and turn southwest once you pass between the 
mountains.  Go west from the poisonous swamp area taking care not to step onto 
it and you'll see the Cave of Necrogond.  Enter!

	Head west from the entrance passing all the statues and head up the 
staircase at the end to reach the second floor.  Take the path leading to the </span><span id="faqspan-5">
west from the stairs and you'll reach a small room where you'll have the choice
of a path to the left or right.  Take the left path down to a treasure chest 
containing 784G coins, then return to the room and go right.  Follow this 
corridor as it turns south and then west and you'll come to another treasure 
chest.  Open it up to find the THUNDER SWORD.  This is the best weapon for your 
Hero at the moment so be sure to equip it right away!  Go south from the chest 
into a larger room.  Take the hallway on the left and through the next smaller 
room to another treasure chest at the end containing the SWORDEDGE ARMOR.  This
is a special piece of equipment for your Hero or Soldier that will damage the 
enemy if the wearer is hit.  I personally had my Soldier equip it since my Hero
had the Armor of Terrafirma, but it's up to you.  Head back one room to the 
right and take the passage to the south into a room with a stairway.  Take 
these stairs up to the next floor.

	Walk south from the stairs on the next floor and continue following 
this passage until you get to 6 pitfalls.  These may seem significant but they 
really aren't.  Just walk passed them to the east and up the stairs at the end.

	On the next floor, head east down the hallway and fall down the zig-zag
pit at the end.  When you fall down, walk east from your drop point and walk up
the stairs you see in the northeast corner.  Now just follow the path on the 
next floor east and then south.  Be careful NOT to fall down the pit, though!
Head up the stairs against the wall in front of the pit.

	We're at the last floor; almost there!  The general direction you want 
to move on this floor is east, but you have to cross a series of bridges to 
get there.  Head south from the stairs and cross the first bridge you see to the
right.  Walk north as soon as you cross the bridge and take the path to the 
right all the way down until you see another path breaking off to the south.  
Follow this passage to find another bridge and cross it to the east.  Keep 
moving east into the passage way and take the next path to the south when you
can.  Now all you have to do is follow this path east and then all the way 
north to a staircase in the northeast corner of the floor to exit the cave.
Whew!

	When you exit the cave, Castle Baramos will be in view but it seems 
there's no way for you to get there on foot.  Well, you're right.  However, 
enter the shrine to the northeast of the cave's exit and speak with the man 
inside.  He will happily hand over the last of the colored orbs; the SILVER ORB.
Once you've obtained the Silver Orb, cast Return to Aliahan and let's get out 
of here for now!

	Now's the perfect time to rest for free at your house by speaking to 
your mother.  You'll also want to SAVE YOUR GAME for sure.  If you've placed 
any of your orbs in the Vault, be sure to pick them up because you'll need all 
6 of them to continue with what we want to do.  Just as a recap, I'll list 
briefly where we found all of the orbs just in case you put one off at some 
point and forgot:

GREEN ORB  - Tedanki at night; speak to the prisoner (requires Final Key).
PURPLE ORB - Defeat Orochi a second time in Jipang.
BLUE ORB   - Navel of the Earth
RED ORB    - House of Pirates
YELLOW ORB - Your Merchant's town (after he's thrown in jail)
SILVER ORB - Shrine of Necrogond

	Double check that you have all of the orbs and then leave Aliahan and 
cast Return (or use a Wing of Wyvern if you won't want to waste the MP) to 
Lancel.  Get on your ship and sail southwest of Lancel and the Navel of the 
Earth and eventually you'll hit an icy continent in the south known as 
Liamland.  Land here and trek west towards the center and you'll spot a 
shrine.

	Enter the Shrine of Liamland and speak with the two elves here.  You'll
notice 6 pedistals encircling an egg in the center.  Walk up to each pedistal 
and use each orb (stand on the blue square) to ignite the flames.  Once you've
placed all 6 orbs on the pedistals, speak to the elves and the legendary bird 
Ramia will hatch from its egg and fly off.  Talk to the elves one more time and
Ramia will be waiting outside.

	Ramia is the ultimate form of transportation.  Stand over the bird and 
use the A button to get on.  When you want to land, press the A button again.  
Just know that you can't land on gray mountains or in the ocean.  Also, when you
cast Return to any town or castle Ramia will follow you much like the ship does.
You won't have to worry about random encounters while flying either.  Ramia is 
the only way you can reach Castle Baramos, so when you're ready (heal up, save 
your game), mount the bird and fly to the west and land right outside Baramos' 
Castle (just west of the Shrine of Necrogond where you got the Silver Orb).  If
you don't have a Sage or Pilgrim that knows Barrier yet, I highly advise 
leveling them up until they reach LVL 32.  Without Barrier in the fight with 
Baramos, you'll take a lot of damage very quickly and potentially get wiped out
in a few short rounds.

	Here is a little equipment check that I've put together.  Below is a 
quick list of the best equipment for each class up to this point in the game.
If you're using a Fighter like I did, it still might be best to stick with the
Iron Claw unless you want to get viciously attacked by monsters every few steps
in Baramos' Castle by bringing the Golden Claw.  You may not need to know the 
best equipment for a Goof-Off at this point, but just for fun here they are:

HERO     - Thunder Sword, Swordedge Armor, Silver Shield, Iron Mask
SOLDIER  - Dragon Killer, Armor of Terrafirma, Silver Shield, Iron Mask
PILGRIM  - Zombie Slasher, Magic Armor, Silver Shield, Iron Helmet, 
           (Meteorite Armband)
SAGE     - Zombie Slasher, Magic Armor, Silver Shield, Iron Helmet, 
           (Meteorite Armband)
FIGHTER  - Iron Claw/Golden Claw, Fighting Suit, (Meteorite Armband)
MERCHANT - Zombie Slasher, Half Plate Armor, Iron Shield, Mysterious Hat
GOOF-OFF - Iron Spear, Flashy Clothes, Leather Shield, Mysterious Hat
WIZARD   - Staff of Thunder/Poison Needle, Angel's Robe, Mysterious Hat

If you're really patient, you can earn the Mysterious Hat by defeating Glacier
Bashers on the island of Greenlad (north of Samanao on the ice).  These monsters
can randomly drop one at the end of battle if you're extremely lucky.  Good luck
if you decide to give it a shot!  We'll soon find a better weapon for the 
Soldier, so having the Dragon Killer isn't too important.  If you haven't 
already bought it then don't even bother at this point.

	Head all the way east once you enter and pass up the small building 
that you see.  Once you hit the wall, turn and go north and slip between the 
narrow opening between the castle and the eastern wall.  Then, turn left and 
head into the small building with a set of stairs leading up.  Take them.

	Head west and down the next set of stairs in the room at the end, then 
back on the first floor exit the room you're in and cast StepGuard before 
walking over the electric blue tiles.  At the dead end, take the stairs on the 
back up to the second floor, then follow this narrow hallway all the way to the
end and down the flight of stairs.  You'll be back on the first floor again, 
but in a room with 3 treasure chests.  They contain an UNLUCKY HELMET (cursed),
a WIZARD'S RING, and the DEMON AXE.  Although the Demon Axe sounds like it may
be cursed, it's not.  It's actually the best weapon for the Soldier at this 
point so equip it on him/her right away.

	Go back the way you came and return to the room with the electric blue
tiles.  Take the stairs on the far left this time and follow the corridor in 
the basement east (ignore the staircase you see as you enter).  At the end, 
take the stairs back up to the first floor and then take the northeast passage 
to find another set of stairs.  Head up this staircase and then walk west and 
down the next set.  You'll now find yourself in a grassy area somewhere in the 
center of the castle.  Walk northwest and down the stairs in the room with the 
white and blue tiles around the border.  Now follow the narrow path on the 
next floor all the way north and up some stairs.

	Walk south but before you walk into the opening to your left, cast 
StepGuard.  Move west and exit this building to the south (don't bother trying 
to talk to the skeleton on the thrown; it's a decoy).  Walk east and cross 
the stone path over the water to a staircase surrounded by damaging blue tiles
(don't forget StepGuard).

	You're now on the basement area where you'll find the Archfiend Baramos.
Before you even move, dedicate one person to heal everyone else and use the 
Wizard's Ring you found earlier to replinish that person's MP.  Now, approach 
the big fat lizard and he'll have a word with you before you engage in battle.

+-----------------+  Baramos' attacks are pretty nasty; he'll attack twice per |
| round and will use firey spells like Explodet which will do about 70 damage  |
| to each character and Blazemost.  A good way to counter this is to cast      |
| Barrier at the beginning to half this damage.  Your Hero should have a go    |
| with StopSpell once or twice to possibly seal Baramos' magic.  It doesn't    |
| work all the time but there's always a chance.  Your Soldier/Fighter should  |
| do a majority of the attacking with Bikill in effect on him.  This will hit  |
| Baramos for about 120+ damage each round.  Healing is also extremely         |
| important.  Keep an eye on your HP and abuse Healall when necessary.  If a   |
| character falls, immediately use the Leaf of the World Tree you got earlier  |
| or result to Vivify if you need to.  You may want to dedicate 1 or 2         |
| characters to just using Healall every round after the first one regardless  |
| of the state your HP is in.                                                  |
|                                                                              |
| Just hang in there and keep healing and attacking.  If you're finding that   |
| he's just too tough right now, there's no shame in leveling up a few before  |
| trying again.  Personally, everybody in my party was level 32-33 and this    |
| still wasn't a cakewalk.                                                     |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	After the battle, your party will be fully healed.  Head back up the 
stairs and then cast Return to Aliahan (it's the only place you can go).

	Enter the town and news of your victory has already spread.  Speak with 
the townfolk if you wish and then head into the castle.  Head upstairs to the 
throne room and talk to the King.  As the King begins to sing your praise, all 
of a sudden the ground begins to shake and the guards all disappear!

	The voice of the demon king Zoma is then heard.  Apparently, although 
the Archfiend Baramos was defeated, Zoma still rules another realm and your 
world is still in danger.  Speak with the King one last time and then talk to 
the minister beside him to save your game.

	When you return to town, it seems as though everyone else didn't hear 
the voice of Zoma.  Little do they know that it's not over.  The next thing we 
need to do is figure out how to get to the world of darkness where Zoma is.  
There's still a few things to take care of in this world before we continue, 
though.  

	First, leave Aliahan and cast Return to Portoga.  Walk west a few steps
and then south from the entrance of town and speak to the woman on the left at 
the table.  After a few words, she'll hand over the SWORD OF ILLUSION.  This 
unique weapon can only be equipped by females of the Soldier, Merchant, or Goof-
Off class.  This sword is the best possible weapon for a female Goof-Off, just 
FYI.	

	Now cast Return to Kanave.  Once you reach Kanave, fly directly east 
over the river and then south to find a castle surrounded by mountains a ways
north of the Promontory of Olivia (clearly the only way to get here is by 
Ramia).  Land inside the mountains and enter the Castle of the Dragon Queen.

	Head north once you're inside and open the red door on the left once 
you get to the castle itself.  Walk north through this room and then open the 
next door you see in here.  Open another red door and head south in the narrow 
hallway all the way down to the end.  Continue walking south into the darkness 
to find a hidden room where you'll find the Dragon Queen.  Speak with her and 
she will hand over the SPHERE OF LIGHT which will help you in defeating Zoma.  
After she hands over the item, she'll perish leaving an egg (AKA the Dragonlord
from the first Dragon Warrior game).

	There's nothing left for us to do here.  Leave the Castle of the Dragon 
Queen and mount Lamia.  Fly down to where Baramos' Castle was in Necrogond and 
just east of the Shrine of Necrogond you'll find a small poisonous island with 
a pit in the center.  Land here and enter.

a completely different (yet very familiar) world...

	You'll fall down into the world below.  Head inside the building and 
speak to the man inside to learn that this is the dark world of Alefgard.  
Alefgard?  Yes, the same world as Dragon Warrior I only this is several years 
before the events of Dragon Warrior I took place.

	Exit the house via the south and you'll find a ship docked outside.  
Pretty convenient, wouldn't you say?  Hop on the ship and exit the port by 
sailing east.  Land your ship and walk east on foot.  You'll notice that the 
overworld music may sound familiar. ;)  Soon you'll notice a town east of the 
port.  This is the castle town of Brecconaly/Tantegel.

	Speak with the locals to learn more about the Master Archfiend Zoma 
and check out the shops.  It's been a while since you've seen an Inn as cheap 
as 4G pieces, so take advantage.  You may notice the ever-so-expensive Falcon 
Sword at the weapon shop.  This weapon will allow the user to attack twice 
per round even though its attack power isn't very high.  You may want to 
eventually purchase one (or two) for some level-grinding later, but for right 
now it's not really important.

	When you're done snooping around, walk over to the east side of town 
and enter the castle.  The castle looks much like it did in Dragon Warrior I.  
Walk north a bit and then make a left at the center and you'll notice a small 
room with 3 treasure chests.  Don't bother; they're all empty.  There is, 
however, an old man behind a counter near the entrance that will completely 
restore your party's MP for free.  Keep this in mind if you ever need it.

	Head upstairs via the main staircase to the throne room and speak with 
the King to save your game.  Do whatever talking you want to the people inside 
the castle and then head over to the east side of the castle on the first floor
to the kitchen area.  Just south of the long table is a hidden passage leading 
into a small room with with a stairway leading up.  Take these stairs to a 
secret room on the second floor where you'll find a chest containing the STONE 
OF SUNLIGHT.  This is a special item we'll need to eventually make it to Zoma's
Castle.  Just hold onto it for now.

	Leave the town of Brecconaly and head west to get back on your ship.  
There's a cave just southwest of Tantegel that we can visit first to gather 
some treasure and level up a bit.  Once you're on your ship, sail west and then
south around the mountains below you.  Land your ship just below this mountain 
range and travel east.  At the end you should see the cave.

	Head east from the entrance and continue to follow the passage east 
and you'll walk into a room with a treasure chest in in bottom right corner.  
Open it up for a WIZARD'S RING and then go back the way you came.  Make your 
way back to the entrance of the cave but take the first path north right 
outside the first room with the stairs leading back out to the world map.
Follow this up and make a left at the two-way split and then turn north again
to find a staircase leading down.  Pass up these stairs for now and take the 
passage to the right.  Keep going and pass the first path you see to the south
and take the second one down into a room with a treasure chest containing 1016G
pieces.  Nice!  Exit this room and make a left then take the first southern 
path you passed before.  This will lead down to some stairs at the end which you
should take.

	At the 4-way intersection, continue moving east and then down into a 
room to find a chest with an INVISIBILITY HERB.  Return to the intersection and
this time go south.  Make a left and then go south again.  Follow this winding 
passage to the west and then north to a small room with 2 treasure chests.  
Open them for the ARMOR OF HADES and a Mimic.  Be aware that the Armor of Hades
is cursed!

	If you'd like you can cast Outside and return to Brecconaly to heal up 
at the Inn.  There's no more treasure in this cave, but if you'd like you can 
stay for a while and level up a bit.  It goes without saying that the monsters
you've encountered so far in Alefgard are TOUGH.  This being the case, there's 
no shame in leveling up.  Not to mention you'll get some good money in the 
process.  I was in my mid-30's with levels and I still had a tough time 
making it through this cave alive.

	After resting in Brecconaly (and saving your game if you wish), there's
a place in the very northwest corner of Alefgard we can visit to pick up a 
useful item.  Remember where Garinham was in Dragon Warrior I?  If not, just 
head far northwest of Tantegel and head west of the cave you come across in the 
small desert.  Around the other side of the mountains you'll find Garin's House.
It looks like a shrine.

	Use your Final Key to open the door and walk inside.  If you speak to 
the two people inside, they'll say that they believe Garin took off with the 
Silver Harp.  Head to the back of the house (along the black wall) and keep 
walking along and pushing against the wall until you discover a secret path 
behind the house.  Head down the stairs back here and open the treasure chest 
underground for the SILVER HARP.

	This item, when used outside of battle, will call forth a random monster
battle.  The Silver Harp is particularly useful when leveling and will come in 
handy later when we can fight larger groups of Metal Babbles without having to 
walk around.

	That's it for Garin's House.  Our next stop is the village of Kol which
is in the far east.  The quickest way to get there is to cast Return to 
Tantegel and get on your ship.  Start by sailing west and then southwest until 
you hit the ocean.  Once you do, turn and sail north hugging the coast to your 
right and you'll reach Garin's House.  Sail east of Garin's House and stay 
close to the coast below you.  You'll pass several small islands along the way, 
but just weave around them as you travel east.  Eventually, you'll come to an 
island with a tower on it.  Just east of this tower on the mainland is the 
village of Kol.

	Enter and talk to the villagers.  On the west side of town is a large 
building that houses a Tool Shop upstairs.  The weapons/armor shop is on the 
east side of the village.  You may want to buy a Water Flying Cloth if you still
have a Wizard, but if not then don't bother.  Purchase a Silver Shield or two 
if you didn't have enough money when you were in Samanao.

	The main reason why we're here now is to find the Fairy Flute.  We'll 
be using this item to obtain another important item a little bit later.  Head 
to the hot spring just west of the Inn and walk 4 steps south of the water in 
the center and search the ground (it'll be behind a tree).  You should uncover 
the FAIRY FLUTE.  Once you've done this, stay at the Inn if you need to and 
you can fight around the Kol area to gain a few levels if you want.  By now you 
should be nearing level 40 or so with your characters.  We'll be revisiting 
Kol a little bit later to obtain the strongest weapon in the game for your Hero.

	For now, cast Return to Tantegel and head south on foot.  Continue 
traveling south until you see a bridge to the west.  Cross this bridge and turn
south again.  Now go east into the desert after passing the mountains and you'll
run into the town of Hauksness (this was the demolished and abandoned town in 
Dragon Warrior I).

Shield of Strength   15000G
Revealing Swimsuit   78000G


	Enter and explore a little bit.  One thing to take note of in the shops
is the Shield of Strength.  Purchase one for your Soldier because it's the best
shield in the game for him.  If you have the extra cash, you could buy one for
your Hero as well, however there will be a special shield that we can find for 
free later.  Don't bother with the Revealing Swimsuit.  Even if you have the 
money it's not worth it at all.  It only adds +1 to a female's Defense.

	Walk south of the weapons/armor shop and into the sand.  Here you'll 
find a few houses.  Walk east of them and you'll come across a horse stable.  
enter the stable and search in the center of the grassy patch by the horses to 
find the ORICON.  What use is this item, you ask?  This is the item we'll need 
to make the best weapon in the game:  the Sword of Kings.

	Cast Return to Kol and head upstairs in the building on the left to the
Tool Shop.  Sell the Oricon to the Tool Shop and then leave the village.  Enter 
Kol again and head back up to the Tool Shop.  Speak to the person behind the 
counter and choose to BUY.  You'll now see the SWORD OF KINGS in the shop's 
inventory for 35000G!  I know it's expensive, but it's well worth the money.  
If you can't purchase it now, make sure to come back as soon as you get the 
money.  You'll definitely want it before you fight the Master Archfiend Zoma.

	Our next stop is the town of Cantlin.  If you spoke with the villagers 
of Hauksness you might have heard that you can find it in the east.  Return to 
Hauksness and travel south until you hit the southern coast of the continent.  
You should then see a bridge leading to the east.  Cross this bridge and head 
northeast through the forest.  You'll spot another bridge soon but ignore this 
one and continue traveling northeast until you hit a second bridge.  Cross this
one to the east over some poisonous swamp ground and then walk directly south 
and you'll reach the town of Cantlin.

	For as big as this town is, there's not much going on.  All the people 
have stopped working out of despair and fear of the Master Archfiend Zoma.  
The only thing worth checking out is the Battle Arena downstairs on the west 
side of town in a building.  Try your luck!

	Speaking with the man on the south end of town surrounded by the 
damaging blue tiles will inform you that you'll need 3 items to get to Zoma's 
Castle.  One of which we already have.  In order to get the remaining two items,
we'll need to go through a few more challenging dungeons.

	Fight around the Cantlin area if you wish to rack up some gold pieces 
for any equipment you haven't purchased yet, then cast Return to Kol.  Walk 
directly west and get on your ship, then sail north and then east around the 
top of the continent.  Turn south when you can and just follow the coastline 
all the way south and you'll hit the southern continent just below the cave 
south of Kol.  Land somewhere here and head southwest.  Eventually you'll notice
a small lake encircled by some mountains.  In the center of this you'll find 
the town of Rimuldar.

	Enter and stay at the Inn if necessary.  You can also use your Final 
Key to open the doors inside the Inn to a treasure chest containing the RING OF 
LIFE.  This item will restore the wearer's HP with each step he or she takes!  
Definitely something you don't want to pass up.

	At the Weapons/Armor Shop, don't bother purchasing the Sword of 
Destruction.  Not only is it expensive, but it's cursed as well.  Buying a 
Falcon Sword wouldn't be a bad idea if you haven't already, though.  Outside 
you'll run into several Metal Babbles and the Falcon Sword can be very helpful 
when trying to beat them since it attacks twice.

	Speak with the townfolk to learn about the Sacred Amulet and more about
the Archfiend (you can find several hidden pathways in this town that lead to 
useful information).  Other than that, we're done here for now.

	SPECIAL NOTE:  Right outside of Rimuldar is the best place in the game 
to level up your characters.  With as many Metal Babbles as you'll find, you 
could find yourself jumping 4 to 5 levels in no time at all (depending on your 
luck).  Keep this in mind when you're about to tackle the final boss later!

	Return to Tantegel and travel northwest on foot.  Remember that cave 
you saw on your way to Garin's House?  Enter this cave and this is where we'll 
find the best shield in the game for your Hero.

	This cave isn't very hard to navigate through at all, but there's one 
thing that sets it apart from any other.  You can't cast magic inside!  With
this said, you may want to bring some Medical Herbs even if they don't heal 
much.  From the entrance, just head in the general southeast direction and 
you'll come to some stairs in the corner leading down.  Take this stairway to 
the floor below and follow the passage west.  Turn and head north at the end 
and follow the winding path.  At the top, go east all the way and then turn 
north and head back west all the way to the stairs at the end of the hallway.

	On the bottom floor, just go north and walk through the broken area in 
the wall to find a room with 5 treasure chests.  Open them for 960G pieces, 
1016G pieces, a STONE OF LIFE, a Mimic (careful, you can't cast spells on this 
floor if you need to), and the SHIELD OF HEROES!

	Give the Shield of Heroes to your Hero right away and equip it.  Since
we can't cast Outside, you'll have to backtrack all the way back outside.  Be 
cautious and flee from battles if you must.  If you make it out alive, then 
congrats!

	Our next destination is the tower on the island west of Kol that we 
saw on our way over there.  In this tower we'll be able to get our hands on the 
Sacred Amulet.  Make sure you have the Fairy Flute with you and then cast Return
to Kol.  Heal up at the Inn and then leave and head west onto your ship.  Now 
just sail a bit northwest to find the island with the tower and enter.

	Open the large door to the tower and walk north.  Use StepGuard to cross
the damaging floor and open the door in front of you.  Keep moving north into a
room with 2 treasure chests.  The chest on the right contains 1016G coins but 
the one on the left is a Mimic.  Now exit this little room and head to your 
left.  In the next room, turn south and take it all the way down to a stairway 
in the bottom corner.

	Head up the stairs to the second floor and go north.  In the next room 
you'll notice two rows of strange tiles.  These tiles alter the direction of 
your steps, so be careful.  If you look closely, there are two different types 
of tiles.  Ones that are darker on the left and lighter on the right, and others
that are lighter on the left and darker on the right.  Here are the different 
directions you will walk when you press a certain direction on the D-Pad:

DARK on the LEFT, LIGHT on the RIGHT:
D-Pad LEFT  - moves up
D-Pad RIGHT - moves down
D-Pad UP    - moves right
D-Pad DOWN  - moves left

LIGHT on the LEFT, DARK on the RIGHT:
D-Pad LEFT  - moves down
D-Pad RIGHT - moves up
D-Pad UP    - moves left
D-Pad DOWN  - moves right

	I know this sounds confusing as hell, but don't worry.  I'll guide you
through the proper direction combinations you need to make for future scenarios.
Walk east of these tiles to find another group of four.  Stand on the bottom
left tile and press UP, UP.  You'll now be in the center of the floor.  In order
to get to the treasure chests above you, step on the bottom left tile of the 
big group and press RIGHT, RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT.  This should take you straight up
to the group of 4 treasure chests.  Two of them are Mimics (the top right and 
bottom left).  The other two contain a FULL MOON HERB and 960G pieces.  Now 
return to the center by standing on the far left tile and pressing LEFT, LEFT, 
RIGHT, RIGHT.  There are four more treasure chests to the south, so stand on 
the far left tile of the southern group and press RIGHT, RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT.  
Open the chests here for 3 ACORNS OF LIFE and a VITALITY SEED.  Nice!  Now 
return to the center again by standing on the far left tile and pressing RIGHT, 
RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT.  Now walk to the right side and stand on the bottom left tile
of the group of four.  Press DOWN, DOWN to get to the other side and you'll see 
a staircase in the upper right corner.  Take these stairs up to the next floor.

	Head south on the third floor until you reach another set of stairs 
leading up.  Take these and then walk north once you're on the fourth floor.  
Soon you'll come to an area with some of those weird tiles on your left.  Walk 
over to them and stand on the bottom right tile of the first group of six.  
Press UP, UP, UP to move to the left and then on the next set press DOWN, DOWN,
DOWN to get to the treasure chest containing the ARMOR OF RADIANCE.  This is the
best piece of armor for your Hero, so equip it on him.

	Now fall down the pit and head south once you land on the floor below.
Exit the large room you land in and then go west down the hallway.  Just follow
this passage as it turns north and you'll find a treasure chest at the very top
corner (careful, it's a Mimic).  East of this chest is another group of strange
tiles.  The idea on these is to purposely fall off the edge of the tower to the 
north.  So just step on one of the tiles and move the D-Pad around until you
fall off the northern edge.

	This will place you right outside the tower on the first floor.  Open
the large door south of you and enter the tower again.  Go west once you're 
inside and up the stairs in this room.  Head east on this floor and cross both 
sets of tiles by pressing DOWN, DOWN for both of them.  Once you're on the 
other side, walk up the stairs to the next floor and then up the next set of 
stairs.  Now just walk all the way west to the last set of stairs to find 
yourself on the top floor.

	Walk south from the stairs once you're on the fifth floor and follow 
the path as it turns east at the end.  Head north into the center of the floor 
and use your Final Key (or the Open spell) to open the large door in front of 
you.  Enter the room and stand in front of the gray statue.  Use your Fairy 
Flute that you found in Kol and the statue of Rubiss will come to life.  She 
will hand over the SACRED AMULET and then disappear.  This item can actually
be equipped by &quot;using&quot; the Sacred Amulet in your character's inventory.  It
will reduce the effectiveness of the Defeat spell when enemies use it on
your party.

	Now that we have two of the three items needed to get to Zoma's Castle,
we still need the Staff of Rain.  Cast Outside and then Return to Rimuldar to 
heal up.

	Get on your ship and sail south as you follow the eastern coast of the 
continent containing Rimuldar.  Just continue to follow the coastline down and 
then southwest.  Eventually, you'll come to a shrine in the middle of a 
poisonous swamp just south of Cantlin.  Enter the shrine and speak to the woman
on the throne and she'll quickly hand over the STAFF OF RAIN.  That was easy.

	Now that we have all 3 items needed to create a bridge to Zoma's Castle,
we need to combine them all to create the Rainbow Drop.

	Exit the shrine and get back on your ship and sail directly east.  You 
will hit an island with a shrine in the center of a forest surrounded by 
mountains.  Enter the shrine with the Stone of Sunlight, the Staff of Rain, and
the Sacred Amulet and speak to the old man behind the counter.  He will trade 
you the RAINBOW DROP for the Stone of Sunlight and the Staff of Rain.

	Once you have the Rainbow Drop, you're free to take on Castle Zoma.  
Just make sure you come prepared.  It'd be safe to have your characters at 
level 44 or above and bring along any Wizard's Rings that you've collected 
throughout the game.  The Ring of Life and some Stones of Life would be helpful
as well.  Pretty much anything that can make your life a little easier would be
great.

	Here is a quick summary of the best equipment (based on attack and 
defense bonuses alone) BEFORE entering Zoma's Castle for each class in the game.
Use this as a reference if you wish; keep in mind that I did not use cursed 
items like the Sword of Destruction, Noh Mask, Unlucky Helmet, etc. for obvious 
reasons.  Since you can only obtain one Meteorite Armband, Ring of Life, and 
Sacred Amulet, I'll let you decide which character you want to place them on.  
I recommend giving the Meteorite Armband to a Fighter if you have one, but 
that's just me.  Also, I've included the Golden Claw for the Fighter simply 
because it technically adds the most ATK power for that character, but I don't
suggest you use it.  The only way to counter the Golden Claw's enemy encounter-
rate curse is with Repel, and it doesn't really work all too well either.  I'd
say stick with the Iron Claw.

HERO:  LVL 45			FIGHTER:  LVL 40-45
-------------			----------------
Sword of Kings			Iron Claw/Golden Claw
Armor of Radiance		Fighting Suit
Shield of Heroes		(Meteorite Armband)
Iron Mask
(Sacred Amulet)

SOLDIER:  LVL 40-45		MERCHANT:  LVL 40-45
----------------		-----------------
Thor's Sword			Zombie Slasher
Swordedge Armor			Half Plate Armor/Magic Bikini (if female)
Shield of Strength		Iron Shield
Iron Mask			Turban/Mysterious Hat
(Ring of Life)			(Sacred Amulet)

PILGRIM:  LVL 40-45		WIZARD:  LVL 40-45
----------------		---------------
Zombie Slasher			Staff of Thunder/Poison Needle
Magic Armor			Water Flying Cloth
Silver Shield			Mysterious Hat
Iron Helmet			(Meteorite Armband)
(Sacred Amulet)

SAGE:  LVL 40-45		GOOF-OFF:  LVL 40-45
-------------			-----------------
Zombie Slasher/Falcon Sword	Iron Spear/Sword of Illusion (if female)
Magic Armor			Flashy Clothes/Magic Bikini (if female)
Silver Shield			Leather Shield
Iron Helmet			Turban/Mysterious Hat
(Sacred Amulet)			(Ring of Life)

	When you're all set and ready to go, heal up at an Inn and SAVE YOUR
GAME.  Make sure to have the Sphere of Light in your inventory as well!  This is
extremely important.  You don't want to make it all the way to Zoma and realize 
you don't have the Sphere of Light to weaken him.

	Return to Rimuldar and travel northwest.  Soon you'll come to a desert </span><span id="faqspan-6">
area.  Continue walking northwest and all the way to the end of the small 
peninsula that sticks out to the west.  Use your Rainbow Drop on the edge and 
a bridge will be created.  Cross the bridge west and just follow the path 
south.  Use StepGuard to move northwest across the poisonous swamp safely and 
then head north into the castle.  Dun dun duh!

	Start by moving north to the statues and then follow the path east.  
Take this long hallway all the way around as it goes north, west, and then 
south.  Ignore the two large doors you see and head west after you pass them.  
In the center of the floor you'll notice a larger room with a large door.  Open 
the door and move north.  As you're about to pass the first 2 statues, a stone 
wall will block your escape and you'll be forced to continue onward.  At the 
north end of the room you'll notice you've been blocked in there as well.  
We're trapped!  Turn around and go back the other way and the 2 statues will 
come to life and attack you as 2 Granite Titans.  Defeat them and walk to the 
north end of the room again and you'll be attacked twice more by the remaining 
statues.  After you've defeated them all (heal up if necessary), exit this 
room via the north and cast StepGuard before walking on the blue tiles.  Head 
around and stand 2 steps behind the throne on the right (not directly behind it,
but more-so to the left side) and search the ground.  This will uncover a hidden
stairway.  Take them down and then take the next staircase down.

	If you hate those crazy directional tiles, then you'll despise this 
floor.  But don't worry, I'll make sure you despise it a little less by giving 
you directions.  Head north from the stairs and when you get to the tiles, make
a right to avoid them at first and head north onto a cluster of eight with 2 
rows of 4.  Stand on the bottom-left tile and press RIGHT, RIGHT.  This should 
take you two steps north.  Now step onto the tile directly above you and press 
RIGHT, RIGHT again.  You'll now be standing on a blank space surrounded by 
tiles.  Step on the one to your left and press LEFT, LEFT.  This will take you 
2 steps north again.  Step onto the tile directly above you and hit DOWN, RIGHT.
Walk over the tile to the north by pressing RIGHT on top of it and then walk 
onto the tile to your left and press RIGHT.  There should now be just one tile 
in your way above you.  Step onto it and press RIGHT and you're now free to take
the stairs just north of you.

	Move west from the stairs and follow this path when it turns south 
(ignoring the opening in the wall along the way).  Take this passage down until
you see an opening to your left and walk through it and continue south.  This
will take you to a room with a treasure chest containing a MULTI-EDGE SWORD.  
Don't bother equipping it, though; it's cursed!  Now go back north the way you 
came and head back through the opening in the wall.  Continue going south and 
then east when the hallway turns.  Walk south through the opening and then 
continue east.  Now just follow this path all the way to the end where you'll
find a stairway.  Take them down to the next level.

	Don't worry, we're getting there.  Walk up the stone steps and use your
Final Key to open the big gray door.  Follow this path east, north, and then 
west across a long bridge and you'll witness a scene between another warrior and
a hydra.  What?!  It's your father, Ortega!  Well no wonder everybody thought he
disappeared.  He fell into the Great Pit of Giaga just like you did.  Watch the 
battle and witness Ortega fall to the powerful King Hydra.  Afterwards, Ortega 
is so delirious and injured that he doesn't even recognize his own son (or 
daughter).  After he perishes, continue following the path west and then north.
Take this hallway all the way up and then make a right at the statue.  Soon 
you'll notice a large door below you.  Open the door and head south into a room
with a row of treasure chests.  Starting from the left to the right they are a 
Mimic, a STONE OF LIFE, a LEAF OF THE WORLD TREE, the SAGE'S STONE, a WIZARD'S 
RING, and another Mimic.  Definitely some VERY useful items.  Especially the 
Sage's Stone.  Give this item to your Pilgrim or Sage.  When used in battle, it 
acts as a powered-up Healus spell and doesn't use any MP!  It can only be used 
in battle, though.  Return north to the hallway you came from and continue on 
your way to the right.  When you hit the statue, go south all the way to a 
staircase at the end.  Head down to find yourself on the last floor!

	Before you move onward, take this time to heal everyone's HP to the max 
and possibly use one of your Wizard's Rings to replinish some MP.  Walk up to 
the platform and a familiar face will greet you.

| Stone every round after putting up Barrier and Increase.  This will save you |

+-----------------+  Baramos Bomus casts fire-based spells like Explodet and   |
| has high Defense.  With this knowledge, it would be wise to have your        |
| magic-users cast Barrier at the beginning of battle, and then use either Sap |
| on Baramos Bomus or BiKill on your Hero and Soldier/Fighter.  Much like      |
| Baramos, you can use StopSpell to seal his magic.  Once you've got these     |
| spells up, just keep attacking and using the Sage's Stone every round and    |
| Baramos Bomus should go down quickly.                                        |
|                                                                              |
| You'll gain 4067 experience and 540G coins for felling Baramos Bomus.        |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	After the fight, heal up as usual and walk north.  Just as you're about
to reach Zoma, another fight will be triggered.

| ! BOSS BATTLE ! |                        Baramos Gonus                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| HP: 900         |                                                            |
+-----------------+  This guy's attack stat is incredible.  He'll easily do    |
| well over 100 damage to a single character with one hit.  Lucky for us he    |
| only attacks once each round.  Don't allow that to put your guard down,      |
| though.  Cast Increase repeatedly until your defence can't get any higher.   |
| By this time Baramos Gonus should only be doing about 50-60 or so damage with|
| each hit.  Along with Increase, the Sage's Stone will have to be used each   |
| round to stay at a comfortable HP status.  Baramos Gonus has more HP than the|
| other minions, but just keep attacking and using the Sage's Stone and you    |
| should be fine.                                                              |
|                                                                              |
| For winning, your party will get 4767 experience points and 18G pieces.      |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

	As soon as the battle ends, make sure everyone's HP is at the MAX along 
with MP.  Use the remaining Wizard's Rings you have to make sure your party is 
completely replinished and healthy.  Also, give the Sphere of Light to the 
person in your party with the highest Agility (or the person wearing the 
Meteorite Armband).  Since this character will be the first to attack in battle,
it's smart to give them the Sphere of Light so that they'll use it immediately
when the fight starts.  Double check your HP and MP, then step forward and 
speak with Zoma to engage in the final boss fight!

| ! BOSS BATTLE ! |                            Zoma                            |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| HP: 1023        |							       |
+-----------------+  The first round should go something like this:  Hero      |
| attacks, Soldier or Fighter attacks, Pilgrim/Sage use the Sphere of Light,   |
| and Pilgrim/Sage use Sage's Stone.  By now Zoma has probably hit your party  |
| pretty hard, so spend the next round healing and possibly using Barrier to   |
| reduce fire/ice damage that Zoma deals out.  Casting Increase can help, but  |
| using too many support spells seems to prompt Zoma to disable them with a    |
| special attack that he has.  BiKill is great to use on your Hero and Soldier/|
| Fighter when you get the chance.  It'll allow the battle to go by a little   |
| faster when you're hitting around 250 damage each round.  Just be aware that |
| you'll have to set BiKill back up again if Zoma shoots his icey pulse to     |
| disable the support spells.  Healing is the number 1 priority in this fight. |
| Sometimes it takes 2 characters on healing duty while the other two try to   |
| get some hits in.  If at any point a party member falls, don't forget about  |
| your Leaf of the World Tree and the Revive spell.  Keep everyone alive and   |
| useful.  Also, remember your Hero has the Healusall spell.  If there's any   |
| point in the fight that you're seriously desperate for healing, USE IT!      |
|                                                                              |
| Congratulations on defeating the Master Archfiend Zoma!                      |
|                                                                              |

	After defeating the Master Archfiend, he warns you of what the future 
has in store for Alefgard and foreshadows the events of Dragon Warrior I!  
When he disintegrates, walk south as if you were to exit the castle and it will
start to fall apart.  When you fall down the pit, you'll somehow shoot out of 
the ground inside the Cave Northwest of Tantegel!  When you gain control again, 
walk south and up the stairs.

	Just follow the path and soon the cave will begin to fall apart as well.
Keep walking and make your way to the southeast corner of the floor to exit.  
On the last floor, just move in the general northwest direction and you'll 
make it out of the cave!

	Upon reaching the surface, the light will begin to flow through the 
land and peace is finally restored in Alefgard.  Return to Tantegel Castle and 
head up to the throne room to enjoy the ending.

	Congratulations on completing Dragon Warrior III!

	The following chart lists all of the monsters in the game (including 
bosses).  I have listed their name, maximum HP, experience, gold pieces, the 
treasure that they drop if any, and in what region that monster can be found.  
Note that the experience points for each monster are for ONE CHARACTER ONLY.  
In order to find out how many experience points a party of four would earn, 
divide the number by 4 (obviously).

Much like the item and equipment lists, I have listed them in alphabetical 
order.

	First and foremost I'd like to credit Enix for making such an amazing 
game!  Dragon Warrior III is definitely a must-have for all you old school 
NES RPG players out there.

	I owe a HUGE amount of credit to Woodus' Dragon's Den for supplying a 
lot of the list information.  Be sure to check out his site when you get the 
chance.  That's www.woodus.com/den  -  Thanks Woodus!

	Thanks again to Joe Andrade for help on the Item/Equipment lists with
selling prices and other things I missed.  Really appreciate the editing my 
friend!

	And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank GameFAQs for hosting 
this document on the web.
